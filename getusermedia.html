    <p>This document defines a set of JavaScript APIs that allow local media,
    including audio and video, to be requested from a platform.</p>
  </section>


  <section id="sotd">
    <p>This document is not complete. It is subject to major changes and, while
    early experimentations are encouraged, it is therefore not intended for
    implementation. The API is based on preliminary work done in the
    WHATWG.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>


    <p>Access to multimedia streams (video, audio, or both) from local devices
    (video cameras, microphones, Web cams) can have a number of uses, such as
    real-time communication, recording, and surveillance.</p>


    <p>This document defines the APIs used to get access to local devices that
    can generate multimedia stream data. This document also defines the
    MediaStream API by which JavaScript is able to manipulate the stream data
    or otherwise process it.</p>
  </section>


  <section id="conformance">
    <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
    product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it
    contains.</p>


    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
    this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
    ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]], as
    this specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>

      <dd>
        <p>A source is the "thing" providing the source of a media stream
        track. The source is the broadcaster of the media itself. A source can
        be a physical webcam, microphone, local video or audio file from the
        user's hard drive, network resource, or static image.</p>


        <p>Some sources have an identifier which <em title="must" class=
        "rfc2119">must</em> be unique to the application (un-guessable by
        another application) and persistent between application sessions (e.g.,
        the identifier for a given source device/application must stay the
        same, but not be guessable by another application). Sources that must
        have an identifier are camera and microphone sources; local file
        sources are not required to have an identifier. Source identifiers let
        the application save, identify the availability of, and directly
        request specific sources.</p>


        <p>Other than the identifier, other bits of source identity are
        <strong>never</strong> directly available to the application until the
        user agent connects a source to a track. Once a source has been
        "released" to the application (either via a permissions UI,
        pre-configured allow-list, or some other release mechanism) the
        application will be able discover additional source-specific
        capabilities.</p>


        <p>Sources <strong>do not</strong> have constraints -- tracks have
        constraints. When a source is connected to a track, it must conform to
        the constraints present on that track (or set of tracks).</p>


        <p>Sources will be released (un-attached) from a track when the track
        is ended for any reason.</p>


        <p>On the <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object, sources are
        represented by a <code><a>sourceType</a></code> attribute. The behavior
        of APIs associated with the source's capabilities and settings change
        depending on the source type.</p>


        <p>Sources have <code><a>capabilities</a></code> and
        <code><a>settings</a></code>. The capabilities and settings are "owned"
        by the source and are common to any (multiple) tracks that happen to be
        using the same source (e.g., if two different track objects bound to
        the same source ask for the same capability or setting information,
        they will get back the same answer).</p>
      </dd>


      <dt>
        <a>Setting</a> (Source Setting)
      </dt>


      <dd>
        <p>A setting refers to the immediate, current value of the source's
        (optionally constrained) capabilities. Settings are always
        read-only.</p>


        <p>A source's settings can change dynamically over time due to
        environmental conditions, sink configurations, or constraint changes. A
        source's settings must always conform to the current set of mandatory
        constraints that all of the tracks it is bound to have defined, and
        should do its best to conform to the set of optional constraints
        specified.</p>


        <p>A source's settings are directly exposed to audio and video track
        objects through individual read-only attributes. These attributes share
        the same name as their corresponding <a>capabilities</a> and
        <a>constraints</a>.</p>


        <p>Events are available that signal to the application that a source's
        settings have changed.</p>


        <p>A conforming user-agent <em title="must" class="rfc2119">must</em>
        support all the setting names defined in this spec.</p>
      </dd>


      <dt>
        <a>Capabilities</a>
      </dt>


      <dd>
        <p>Source capabilities are the intrinsic "features" of a source object.
        For each source setting, there is a corresponding capability that
        describes whether it is supported by the source and if so, what the
        range of supported values are. Capabilities are expressed as either a
        series of settings (for enumerated-type capabilities) or as a min/max
        range.</p>


        <p>The values of the supported capabilities must be normalized to the
        ranges and enumerated types defined in this specification.</p>


        <p>Capabilities return the same underlying per-source capabilities,
        regardless of any user-supplied constraints present on the source
        (capabilities are independent of constraints).</p>


        <p>Source capabilities are effectively constant. Applications should be
        able to depend on a specific source having the same capabilities for
        any session.</p>
      </dd>


      <dt>
        <a>Constraints</a>
      </dt>


      <dd>
        <p>Constraints are an optional feature for restricting the range of
        allowed variability on a source. Without provided constraints,
        implementations are free to select a source's settings from the full
        ranges of its supported capabilities, and to adjust those settings at
        any time for any reason.</p>


        <p>Constraints may be optional or mandatory. Optional constraints are
        represented by an ordered list, mandatory constraints are an unordered
        set. The order of the optional constraints is from most important (at
        the head of the list) to least important (at the tail of the list).</p>


        <p>Constraints are stored on the track object, not the source. Each
        track can be optionally initialized with constraints, or constraints
        can be added afterward through the constraint APIs defined in this
        spec.</p>


        <p>Applying track level constraints to a source is conditional based on
        the type of source. For example, read-only sources will ignore any
        specified constraints on the track.</p>


        <p>It is possible for two tracks that share a unique source to apply
        contradictory constraints. Under such contradictions, the
        implementation will mute both tracks and notify them that they are
        over-constrained.</p>


        <p>Events are available that allow the application to know when
        constraints cannot be met by the user agent. These typically occur when
        the application applies constraints beyond the capability of a source,
        contradictory constraints, or in some cases when a source cannot
        sustain itself in over-constrained scenarios (overheating, etc.).</p>


        <p>A correspondingly-named constraint exists for each corresponding
        source setting name and capability name. In general, user agents will
        have more flexibility to optimize the media streaming experience the
        fewer constraints are applied.</p>

    <h2>MediaStream API</h2>


    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>


      <p>The <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> interface is used to represent
      streams of media data, typically (but not necessarily) of audio and/or
      video content, e.g. from a local camera. The data from a
      <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object does not necessarily have a
      canonical binary form; for example, it could just be "the video currently
      coming from the user's video camera". This allows user agents to
      manipulate media streams in whatever fashion is most suitable on the
      user's platform.</p>


      <p>Each <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object can contain zero or more
      tracks, in particular audio and video tracks. All tracks in a MediaStream
      are intended to be synchronized when rendered. Different MediaStreams do
      not need to be synchronized.</p>


      <p>Each track in a MediaStream object has a corresponding
      <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object.</p>


      <p>A <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> represents content comprising
      one or more channels, where the channels have a defined well known
      relationship to each other (such as a stereo or 5.1 audio signal).</p>


      <p>A channel is the smallest unit considered in this API
      specification.</p>


      <p>A <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object has an input and an output.
      The input depends on how the object was created: a
      <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object generated by a <code><a href=
      "#dom-navigator-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a></code> call (which is
      described later in this document), for instance, might take its input
      from the user's local camera. The output of the object controls how the
      object is used, e.g., what is saved if the object is written to a file or
      what is displayed if the object is used in a <code>video</code>
      element.</p>


      <p>Each track in a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object can be
      disabled, meaning that it is muted in the object's output. All tracks are
      initially enabled.</p>


      <p>A <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> can be <a>finished</a>, indicating
      that its inputs have forever stopped providing data.</p>


      <p>The output of a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object MUST correspond
      to the tracks in its input. Muted audio tracks MUST be replaced with
      silence. Muted video tracks MUST be replaced with blackness.</p>


      <p>A new <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object can be created from
      accessible media sources (that does not require any additional
      permissions) using the <code><a href=
      "#dom-mediastream">MediaStream()</a></code> constructor. The constructor
      argument can either be an existing <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>
      object, in which case all the tracks of the given stream are added to the
      new <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object, or an array of
      <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> objects. The latter form makes it
      possible to compose a stream from different source streams.</p>


      <p><img alt="A MediaStream" src="images/media-stream.png" width="418" />
      </p>


      <p>Both <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> and
      <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> objects can be cloned. This allows
      for greater control since the separate instances can be manipulated and
      <a title="consumer">consumed</a> individually. A cloned
      <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> contains clones of all member tracks from
      the original stream.</p>


      <p>When a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object is being generated from
      a local file (as opposed to a live audio/video source), the user agent
      SHOULD stream the data from the file in real time, not all at once. The
      <code>MediaStream</code> object is also used in contexts outside
      <code>getUserMedia</code>, such as [[!WEBRTC10]]. In both cases, ensuring
      a realtime stream reduces the ease with which pages can distinguish live
      video from pre-recorded video, which can help protect the user's
      privacy.</p>

      <h2>MediaStream</h2>


      <p>The <dfn id="dom-mediastream"><code>MediaStream()</code></dfn>
      constructor composes a new stream out of existing tracks. It takes an
      optional argument of type <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> or an array of
      <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> objects. <dfn id=
      'mediastream-constructor'>When the constructor is invoked</dfn>, the UA
      must run the following steps:</p>


      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Let <var>stream</var> be a newly constructed
          <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Initialize <var>stream's</var> <code><a href=

        </li>


        <li>
          <p>If the constructor's argument is present, run the sub steps that
          corresponds to the argument type.</p>


          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><code>Array</code> of <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>
              objects:</p>


              <p>Run the following sub steps for each

                  <p><em>Add track</em>: Let <var>track</var> be the

                </li>


                <li>
                  <p>If <var>track</var> has <a href="#track-ended">ended</a>,
                  then abort these steps and continue with the next track (if
                  any).</p>
                </li>


                <li>

            </li>


            <li>
              <p><code><a>MediaStream</a></code>:</p>


              <p>Run the sub steps labeled <em>Add track</em> (above) for every

              <a href="#track-set">track set</a>.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>


        <li>
          <p>If <var>stream</var>'s <a href="#track-set">track set</a> is
          empty, set <var>stream</var>'s <code><a href=
          "#dom-mediastream-active">active</a></code> attribute to
          <code>false</code>, otherwise set it to <code>true</code>.</p>
        </li>


        <li>
          <p>Return <var>stream</var>.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>


      <p>A <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> can have multiple audio and video
      sources (e.g. because the user has multiple microphones, or because the
      real source of the stream is a media resource with many media tracks).
      The stream represented by a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> thus has zero
      or more tracks.</p>


      <p>The tracks of a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> are stored in a
      <dfn id="track-set">track set</dfn>. The track set MUST contain the
      <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> objects that correspond to the
      tracks of the stream. The relative order of the tracks in the set is user
      agent defined and the API will never put any requirements on the order.
      The proper way to find a specific <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>
      object in the set is to look it up by its <code><a href=
      "#dom-mediastreamtrack-id">id</a></code>.</p>


      <p>An object that reads data from the output of a
      <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> is referred to as a
      <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> <dfn>consumer</dfn>. The list of
      <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> consumers currently include the media
      elements [[!HTML5]], <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> [[!WEBRTC10]],
      <code>MediaRecorder</code> [[!mediastream-rec]] and
      <code>ImageCapture</code> [[!mediastream-imagecap]].</p>


      <p class="note"><code><a>MediaStream</a></code> consumers must be able to
      handle tracks being added and removed. This behavior is specified per
      consumer.</p>


      <p>A <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object is said to be <dfn id=
      "stream-inactive">inactive</dfn> when it does not have any tracks or all
      tracks belonging to the stream have <a href="#track-ended">ended</a>.
      Otherwise the stream is active. A <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> can
      start its life as inactive if it is constructed without any tracks.</p>


      <p>When a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> goes from being active to
      inactive, the user agent MUST queue a task that sets the object's
      <code><a href="#dom-mediastream-active">active</a></code> attribute to
      <code>false</code> and fire a simple event named <code><a href=
      "#event-mediastream-inactive">inactive</a></code> at the object. When a
      <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> goes from being inactive to active, the
      user agent MUST queue a task that sets the object's <code><a href=
      "#dom-mediastream-active">active</a></code> attribute to
      <code>true</code> and fire a simple event named <code><a href=
      "#event-mediastream-active">active</a></code> at the object.</p>


      <p>If the stream's activity status changed due to a user request, the
      task source for this <span title="concept-task">task</span> is the user
      interaction task source. Otherwise the task source for this <span title=
      "concept-task">task</span> is the networking task source.</p>

      <h2>MediaStreamTrack</h2>


      <p>A <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object represents a media
      source in the user agent. Several <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>
      objects can represent the same media source, e.g., when the user chooses
      the same camera in the UI shown by two consecutive calls to
      <code><a href="#dom-navigator-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a></code>
      .</p>


      <p>A script can indicate that a track no longer needs its source with the
      <code><a href=
      "#dom-mediastreamtrack-stop">MediaStreamTrack.stop()</a></code> method.
      When all tracks using a source have been stopped, the given permission
      for that source is revoked and the source is <dfn id=
      "source-stopped">stopped</dfn>. If the data is being generated from a
      live source (e.g., a microphone or camera), then the user agent SHOULD
      remove any active "on-air" indicator for that source. If the data is
      being generated from a prerecorded source (e.g. a video file), any
      remaining content in the file is ignored. An implementation may use a per
      source reference count to keep track of source usage, but the specifics
      are out of scope for this specification.</p>


      <section>
        <h3>Life-cycle and Media Flow</h3>


        <p>A <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> has three stages in its
        lifecycle; <code>new</code>, <code>live</code> and <code>ended</code>.
        A track begins as <code>new</code> prior to being connected to an
        active source.</p>


        <p>Once connected, the <code><a href=
        "#event-mediastreamtrack-started">started</a></code> event fires and
        the track becomes <code>live</code>. In the <code>live</code> state,
        the track is active and media is available for rendering at a
        <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> <a>consumer</a>.</p>


        <p>A muted or disabled <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> renders
        either silence (audio), black frames (video), or a
        zero-information-content equivalent. For example, a video element
        sourced by a muted or disabled <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>
        (contained within a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>), is playing but
        the rendered content is the muted output.</p>


        <p>The muted/unmuted state of a track reflects if the source provides
        any media at this moment. The enabled/disabled state is under
        application control and determines if the track outputs media (to its
        consumers). Hence, media from the source only flows when a
        <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object is both unmuted and
        enabled.</p>


        <p>A <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> is <dfn id=
        "track-muted">muted</dfn> when the source is temporarily unable to
        provide the track with data. A track can be muted by a user. Often this
        action is outside the control of the application. This could be as a
        result of the user hitting a hardware switch, or toggling a control in
        the operating system or browser chrome. A track can also be muted by
        the user agent. For example, a track that is a member of a
        <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>, received via a
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> [[!WEBRTC10]], is muted if the
        application on the other side disables the corresponding track in the
        <code>MediaStream</code> being sent.</p>


        <p>Applications are able to <dfn id="track-enabled">enable</dfn> or
        disable a <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> to prevent it from
        rendering media from the source. A muted track will however, regardless
        of the enabled state, render silence and blackness. A disabled track is
        logically equivalent to a muted track, from a consumer point of
        view.</p>


        <p>For a newly created <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object, the
        following applies. The track is always enabled unless stated otherwise
        (for examlpe when cloned) and the muted state reflects the state of the
        source at the time the track is created.</p>


        <p>A <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object is said to
        <em>end</em> when the source of the track is disconnected or
        exhausted.</p>


        <p>When a <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object ends for any
        reason (e.g., because the user rescinds the permission for the page to
        use the local camera, or because the data comes from a finite file and
        the file's end has been reached and the user has not requested that it
        be looped, or because the UA has instructed the track to end for any
        reason, it is said to be <dfn id="track-ended">ended</dfn>. When track
        instance <var>track</var> ends for any reason other than the
        <code><a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-stop">stop()</a></code> method
        being invoked on the <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object that
        represents <var>track</var>, the user agent MUST queue a task that runs
        the following steps:</p>


        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>If the track's <code><a href=
            "#dom-mediastreamtrack-readystate">readyState</a></code> attribute
            has the value <code>ended</code> already, then abort these steps.
            (The <code><a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-stop">stop()</a></code>
            method was probably called just before the track stopped for other
            reasons.)</p>
          </li>


          <li>
            <p>Set <var>track's</var> <code><a href=
            "#dom-mediastreamtrack-readystate">readyState</a></code> attribute
            to <code>ended</code>.</p>
          </li>


          <li>
            <p>Fire a simple event named <code><a href=
            "#event-mediastreamtrack-ended">ended</a></code> at the object.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>


        <p>If the end of the stream was reached due to a user request, the
        event source for this event is the user interaction event source.</p>

        <h3>Tracks and Constraints</h3>


        <p>Constraints are independent of sources. However, if the
        <code><a>sourceType</a></code> is "none", the
        <code><a>readonly</a></code> attribute is <code>true</code>, or the
        <code><a>remote</a></code> attribute is <code>true</code>, the track's
        constraints will not be applied to the source.</p>


        <p>Whether <code><a>Constraints</a></code> were provided at track
        initialization time or need to be established later at runtime, the
        APIs defined in the <a>Constrainable</a> Interface allow the retrieval
        and manipulation of the constraints currently established on a
        track.</p>


        <p>Each track maintains an internal version of the
        <code><a>Constraints</a></code> structure, namely a mandatory set of
        constraints (no duplicates), and an optional ordered list of individual
        constraint objects (may contain duplicates). The internal stored
        constraint structure is exposed to the application by the
        <code><a>constraints</a></code> attribute, and may be modified by the
        <code><a>applyConstraints()</a></code> method.</p>


        <p>When <code><a>applyConstraints()</a></code> is called, a user agent
        <em title="must" class="rfc2119">must</em> queue a task to evaluate
        those changes when the task queue is next serviced. Similarly, if the
        <a href=
        "#widl-MediaSourceStates-sourceType"><code>sourceType</code></a>
        changes, then the user agent should perform the same actions to
        re-evaluate the constraints of each track affected by that source
        change.</p>

        may be used for two purposes:</p>


        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Displayed in an appropriate tag (e.g., a video or audio
            element). The video element MUST have a unique origin so that it is
            inaccessible to the content JS. This is the same security mechanism
            as is used with an ordinary audio or video element which has a src=
            property from a separate origin.</p>
          </li>


          <li>
            <p>Used as the argument to addStream() for a PeerConnection,
            subject to the restrictions detailed in the WebRTC document.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>


        <p>When the noaccess=true constraint applies to a track, that track may
        be added to any PeerConnection.</p>


        <p class="note">Open Issue: The editors worry that the above paragraph
        is just wrong. If the track can be added to a PeerConnection that is
        connect to another PeerConenction in the same application, the
        application could get access to the data. We sugest this should be
        changed from "may be added" to "may not be added". This will allow
        noaccess=true to be used for things like hair check dialogs.</p>


        <p>When the peerIdentity=foo constraint applies to a track, then that
        track may be added only to PeerConnections with compatible peer
        identities as described in the WebRTC document.</p>


        <p>Both the noaccess and peerIdentity constraints must be mandatory.
        Any use of them in the optional block must trigger an error.</p>

    <h2>The model: sources, sinks, constraints, and states</h2>


    <p>Browsers provide a media pipeline from sources to sinks. In a browser,
    sinks are the &lt;img&gt;, &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; tags.
    Traditional sources include camera, microphones, streamed content, files
    and web resources. The media produced by these sources typically does not
    change over time - these sources can be considered to be static.</p>


    <p>The sinks that display these sources to the user (the actual tags
    themselves) have a variety of controls for manipulating the source content.
    For example, an &lt;img&gt; tag scales down a huge source image of
    1600x1200 pixels to fit in a rectangle defined with
    <code>width="400"</code> and <code>height="300"</code>.</p>


    <p>The getUserMedia API adds dynamic sources such as microphones and
    cameras - the characteristics of these sources can change in response to
    application needs. These sources can be considered to be dynamic in nature.
    A &lt;video&gt; element that displays media from a dynamic source can
    either perform scaling or it can feed back information along the media
    pipeline and have the source produce content more suitable for display.</p>


    <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This sort of feedback loop is obviously just
      enabling an "optimization", but it's a non-trivial gain. This
      optimization can save battery, allow for less network congestion,
      etc...</p>
    </div>


    <p>Note that <code>MediaStream</code> sinks (such as
    <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>, and even
    <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>) will continue to have mechanisms to further
    transform the source stream beyond that which the <a>Settings</a>,
    <a>Capabilities</a>, and <a>Constraints</a> described in this specification
    offer. (The sink transformation options, including those of
    <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, are outside the scope of this
    specification.)</p>


    <p>The act of changing or applying a track constraint may affect the
    <code><a>settings</a></code> of all tracks sharing that source and
    consequently all down-level sinks that are using that source. Many sinks
    may be able to take these changes in stride, such as the
    <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element or <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.
    Others like the Recorder API may fail as a result of a source state
    change.</p>


    <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> is an interesting object because it
    acts simultaneously as both a sink <strong>and</strong> a source for
    over-the-network streams. As a sink, it has source transformational
    capabilities (e.g., lowering bit-rates, scaling-up or down resolutions,
    adjusting frame-rates), and as a source it could have its own states
    changed by a track source (though in this specification sources with the
    <code><a>remote</a></code> attribute set to true do not consider the
    current constraints applied to a track).</p>


    <p>To illustrate how changes to a given source impact various sinks,
    consider the following example. This example only uses width and height,
    but the same principles apply to any of the <a>Settings</a> exposed in this
    proposal. In the first figure a home client has obtained a video source
    from its local video camera. The source's width and height state are 800
    pixels by 600 pixels, respectively. Three <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>
    objects on the home client contain tracks that use this same
    <code><a>sourceId</a></code>. The three media streams are connected to
    three different sinks: a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element (A), another
    <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element (B), and a peer connection (C). The peer
    connection is streaming the source video to an away client. On the away
    client there are two media streams with tracks that use the peer connection
    as a source. These two media streams are connected to two
    <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element sinks (Y and Z).</p>
    <img alt=
    "Changing media stream source effects: before the requested change" src=
    "images/change_states_before.png" />

    <p>Note that at this moment, all of the sinks on the home client must apply
    a transformation to the original source's provided dimension settings. A is
    scaling the video up (resulting in loss of quality), B is scaling the video
    down, and C is also scaling the video up slightly for sending over the
    network. On the away client, sink Y is scaling the video way down, while
    sink Z is not applying any scaling.</p>


    <p>Using the <a>Constrainable</a> interface, the home client's video source
    is changed to a higher resolution (1920 by 1200 pixels).</p>
    <img alt="Changing media stream source effects: after the requested change"
    src="images/change_states_after.png" />

    <p>Note that the source change immediately affects all of the sinks on the
    home client, but does not impact any of the sinks (or sources) on the away
    client. With the increase in the home client source video's dimensions,
    sink A no longer has to perform any scaling, while sink B must scale down
    even further than before. Sink C (the peer connection) must now scale down
    the video in order to keep the transmission constant to the away
    client.</p>


    <p>While not shown, an equally valid settings change request could be made
    of the away client video source (the peer connection on the away client's
    side). This would not only impact sink Y and Z in the same manner as
    before, but would also cause re-negotiation with the peer connection on the
    home client in order to alter the transformation that it is applying to the
    home client's video source. Such a change <strong>would not</strong> change
    anything related to sink A or B or the home client's video source.</p>


    <p>Note that this specification does not define a mechanism by which a
    change to the away client's video source could automatically trigger a
    change to the home client's video source. Implementations may choose to
    make such source-to-sink optimizations as long as they only do so within
    the constraints established by the application, as the next example
    demonstrates.</p>


    <p>It is fairly obvious that changes to a given source will impact sink
    consumers. However, in some situations changes to a given sink may also be
    cause for implementations to adjust the characteristics of a source's
    stream. This is illustrated in the following figures. In the first figure
    below, the home client's video source is sending a video stream sized at
    1920 by 1200 pixels. The video source is also unconstrained, such that the
    exact source dimensions are flexible as far as the application is
    concerned. Two <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> objects contain tracks with
    the same <code><a>sourceId</a></code>, and those
    <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>s are connected to two different
    <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element sinks A and B. Sink A has been sized to
    <code>width="1920"</code> and <code>height="1200"</code> and is displaying
    the source's video content without any transformations. Sink B has been
    sized smaller and, as a result, is scaling the video down to fit its
    rectangle of 320 pixels across by 200 pixels down.</p>
    <img alt=
    "Changing media stream sinks may affect sources: before the requested change"
    src="images/change_states_before2.png" />

    <p>When the application changes sink A to a smaller dimension (from 1920 to
    1024 pixels wide and from 1200 to 768 pixels tall), the browser's media
    pipeline may recognize that none of its sinks require the higher source
    resolution, and needless work is being done both on the part of the source
    and on sink A. In such a case and without any other constraints forcing the
    source to continue producing the higher resolution video, the media
    pipeline MAY change the source resolution:</p>
    <img alt=
    "Changing media stream sinks may affect sources: after the requested change"
    src="images/change_states_after2.png" />

    <p>In the above figure, the home client's video source resolution was
    changed to the greater of that from sinkA and from sinkB in order to
    optimize playback. While not shown above, the same behavior could apply to
    peer connections and other sinks.</p>


    <p>It is possible that <a>constraints</a> can be applied to a track which a
    source is unable to satisfy. When this happens, the user agent is required
    to fire an <a>overconstrained</a> MediaErrorEvent to the track informing it
    of this condition, and the track becomes muted. There is no mandatory
    side-effect on the source itself as a result of this condition.</p>


    <p>When multiple tracks share the same source (as illustrated in the
    previous figures), it is also possible that two (or more) tracks can apply
    contradictory constraints on the source. Since there is only a single
    thread of control, it is always possible for the browser to determine which
    track created the overconstrained condition. In this situation, the user
    agent MUST send the <a>overconstrained</a> MediaErrorEvent only to the
    track that created the condition and MUST not apply any of the constraints
    newly requested for that track. Here is an example of this behavior.</p>


    <p>In this example, two media streams each have a video track that share
    the same source. The first track has a mandatory constraint forcing on the
    source's fill light. That track is connected to sink N. Sink N has a width
    and height of 800 by 600 pixels and is scaling down the source's resolution
    of 1024 by 768 to fit. The other track initially has no constraints
    applied; it is connected to sink P. Sink P has a width and height equal to
    that of the source.</p>


    <p><img alt="Overconstrained" src="images/overconstrained_before.png" />
    </p>


    <p>Now, the second track adds a mandatory constraint that the fill light
    should be forced off. At this point, both mandatory constraints cannot be
    satisfied by the source (the fill light cannot be simultaneously on and off
    at the same time). The second track is transitioned into the muted state
    and receives an <a>overconstrained</a> event. At the same time, the source
    notes that its remaining active sink only requires a resolution of 800 by
    600 and so it adjusts its resolution down to match (this is an optional
    optimization that the user agent is allowed to make given the
    situation).</p>


    <p>At this point, it is the responsibility of the application to fix the
    problem that led to the overconstrained situation (by either removing the
    fill light mandatory constraint on the second track, or by
    changing/removing the fill light mandatory constraint on the first
    track).</p>

    <h2>MediaStreams as Media Elements</h2>


    <p>A <code>MediaStream</code> may be assigned to media elements as defined
    in <a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#media-elements">HTML5</a>
    [[!HTML5]] A <code>MediaStream</code> is not preloadable or seekable and
    represents a simple, potentially infinite, linear media timeline. The
    timeline starts at 0 and increments linearly in real time as long as the
    <code>MediaStream</code> is playing. The timeline does not increment when
    the <code>MediaStream</code> is paused.</p>


    <section>
      <h3>Direct Assignment to Media Elements</h3>


      <p>UAs that support this specification MUST support the following partial
      interface, which allows a MediaStream to be assigned directly to a media
      element.</p>


      <dl class="idl" title="partial interface HTMLMediaElement">
        <dt>attribute MediaStream? srcObject</dt>


        <dd>
          <p>Holds the MediaStream that provides media for this element. This
          attribute overrides both the <code>src</code> attribute and any
          &lt;source&gt; elements. Specifically, if <code>srcObject</code> is
          specified, the UA MUST use it as the source of media, even if the
          <code>src</code> attribute is also set or &lt;source&gt; children are
          present. If the value of <code>srcObject</code> is replaced or set to
          null the UA MUST re-run the <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#media-element-load-algorithm">
          media element load algorithm</a></p>

      <h3>Loading and Playing a MediaStream in a Media Element</h3>


      <p>The UA runs the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#media-element-load-algorithm">
      media element load algorithm</a> to obtain media for the media element to
      display. As defined in the [[HTML5]] specification, this algorithm has
      two basic phases: <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#concept-media-load-algorithm">
      resource selection algorithm</a> chooses the resource to play and
      resolves its URI. Then the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#concept-media-load-resource">
      resource fetch phase</a> loads the resource. Both these phases are
      potentially simplified when using a MediaStream. First of all,
      <code>srcObject</code> takes priority over other means of specifying the
      resource, and it provides the object itself rather than a URI. Therefore,
      there is no need to run the resource selection algorithm. Secondly, when
      the UA reaches the resource fetch algorithm with a MediaStream, the
      MediaStream is a local object so there's nothing to fetch. Therefore, the
      following modifications/restrictions to the <a href=

    <h2>Error Handling</h2>


    <p>All errors defined in this specification implement the following

    <dl class="idl" title="[NoInterfaceObject] interface MediaError">
      <dt>readonly attribute DOMString name</dt>

      <dd>
        <p>This attribute is only used for some types of errors. For
        <code><a>MediaError</a></code> with a name of
        <code>ConstraintNotSatisfiedError</code>, this attribute MUST be set to

      Open Issue: Do we want to allow the constraintName attribute to contain
      multiple constraint names? In many cases the error is raised as soon as a

      possible to determine that multiple constraints are not satisfied.

        resources when it has determined that a given call to <a href=
        "#dom-navigator-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a> will succeed. It is
        preferable to reserve the resource prior to invoking the success
        callback provided by the web page. Subsequent calls to <a href=
        "#dom-navigator-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a> (in this page or any
        other) should treat the resource that was previously allocated, as well
        as resources held by other applications, as busy. Resources marked as
        busy should not be provided as sources to the current web page, unless
        specified by the user. Optionally, the user agent may choose to provide
        a stream sourced from a busy source but only to a page whose origin
        matches the owner of the original stream that is keeping the source
        busy.</p>


        <p class="practicedesc">This document recommends that in the permission
        grant dialog or device selection interace (if one is present), the user
        be allowed to select any available hardware as a source for the stream
        requested by the page (provided the resource is able to fulfill
        mandatory constraints, if any were specified), in addition to the
        ability to substitute a video or audio source with local files and
        other media. A file picker may be used to provide this functionality to
        the user.</p>


        <p class="practicedesc">This document also recommends that the user be
        shown all resources that are currently busy as a result of prior calls
        to <a href="#dom-navigator-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a> (in this
        page or any other page that is still alive) and be allowed to terminate
        that stream and utilize the resource for the current page instead. If
        possible in the current operating environment, it is also suggested
        that resources currently held by other applications be presented and
        treated in the same manner. If the user chooses this option, the track
        corresponding to the resource that was provided to the page whose
        stream was affected must be removed.</p>

        or more webcams in a single stream object, for example. However, the
        current API does not allow a page to express a need for multiple video
        streams from independent sources.</p>


        <p class="practicedesc">It is recommended for multiple calls to

        <p class="practicedesc">A single call to <a href=

        "#dom-navigator-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a> multiple times before
        reaching a stable state, this document advises the UI designer that the
        permission dialogs should be merged, so that the user can give
        permission for the use of multiple cameras and/or media sources in one
        dialog interaction. The constraints on each getUserMedia call can be
        used to decide which stream gets which media sources.</p>

  <section id="constrainable-interface">
    <h2>Constrainable Interface</h2>


    <p>The Constrainable interface allows its consumers to inspect and adjust
    the properties of the object that implements it. It is broken out as a
    separate interface so that it can be used in other specifications.
    The core concept is that of a Capability, which consists of a property or
    feature of an object and the set of its possible values, which may be
    specified either as a range or as an enumeration. For example, a camera
    might be capable of framerates (a property) between 20 and 50 frames per
    second (a range) and may be able to be positioned (a property) facing
    towards the user, away from the user, or to the left or right of the user
    (an enumerated set.) The application can examine a Constrainable object's
    set of Capabilities via the <code>getCapabilities()</code> accessor.</p>


    <p>The application can select the (range of) values it wants for an object's
    Capabilities by means of a ConstraintSet and the <code>applyConstraints()</code>
    method. A ConstraintSet consists of the names of one or more properties 
    of the object plus the desired
    value (or a range of desired values) for each of them.  Each of those
    property/value pairs can be considered to be an individual constraint.
    For example, the application may set
    a ConstraintSet containing two constraints, the first stating that the framerate of a camera be between 30 and 40
    frames per second (a range) and the second that the camera should be facing the
    user (a specific value). ConstraintSets can be mandatory or optional. In the
    case of optional ConstraintSets, the UA will consider the ConstraintSets in the
    order in which they are specified, and will try to satisfy each one, but
    will ignore a ConstraintSet if it cannot satisfy it. In the case of a mandatory
    ConstraintSet, the UA will try to satisfy it, and will call the
    <code>errorCallback</code> if it cannot do so. For example, suppose that an
    application applies three individual constraints, one stating that the video aspect ratio
    should be 3 to 2 (height to width), the next that the height should be 600 
    and the last that
    the width should be 500. Since these constraintss interact with each other
    (the aspect ratio affects the possible values for height and width, and
    vice-versa) it is impossible to satisfy all three of them, so if they are all
    contained in a mandatory ConstraintSet, the UA will call the
    <code>errorCallback</code>. However if any one of the constraints is
    placed in an optional ConstraintSet, the other two can be satisfied, so the UA will satisfy the two
    mandatory ones, silently ignore the optional one, and call the
    <code>successCallback.</code></p>


    <p>The ordering of optional ConstraintSets is significant. In the example in
    the previous paragraph, suppose that aspect ratio constraint is part of 
    a mandatory ConstraintSet
    and that the height and width constraints are part of separate optional 
    ConstraintSets. If the height
    ConstraintSet is specified first (and the other constraints in the ConstraintSet
    can also be satisfied), then it will be satisfied and the width
    ConstraintSet will be ignored. Thus the height will be set to 600 and the the
    width will be set to 400. On the other hand, if width is specified before
    height, the width ConstraintSet will be satisfied and the height ConstraintSet
    will be ignored, resulting in width of 500 and height of 750. (Note that
    the mandatory aspect ratio constraint is enforced in both cases.) The UA
    will attempt to satisfy as many optional ConstraintSets as it can, even if
    some of them cannot be satisfied and must therefore be ignored. Application
    authors can therefore implement a backoff strategy by specifying multiple
    optional ConstraintSets for the same property. For example, an application
    might specify three optional ConstraintSets, the first asking for a framerate
    greater than 500, the second asking for a framerate greater than 400, and
    the third asking for one greater than 300. If the UA is capable of setting
    a framerate greater than 500, it will (and the subsequent two ConstraintSets
    will be trivially satisifed.) However, if the UA cannot set the framerate
    above 500, it will ignore that ConstraintSet and attempt to set the framerate
    above 400. If that fails, it will then try to set it above 300. If the UA
    cannot satisfy any of the three ConstraintSets, it will set the framerate to
    any value it can get. If the developer wanted to insist on 300 as a lower
    bound, he put that in a mandatory ConstraintSet. In that case, the UA
    would fail altogether if it couldn't get a value over 300, but would choose
    a value over 500 if possible, then try for a value over 400. An application
    may inspect the set of ConstraintSets currently in effect via the
    <code>getConstraints()</code> accessor.</p>


    <p>The specific value that the UA chooses for a Capability is referred to
    as a Setting. For example, if the application applies a ConstraintSet specifying
    that the
    framerate must be at least 30 frames per second, and no greater than 40,
    the Setting can be any intermediate value, e.g., 32, 35, or 37 frames per
    second. The application can query the current settings of the object's
    Capabilities via the <code>getSettings()</code> accessor.</p>

            the range value of -10 to "off", 10 to "full", and 0
            to "medium". It might also indicate that given a ConstraintSet

          <p>The algorithm for applying constraints is stated below. Here are
          some preliminary definitions that are used in the statement of the
          algorithm:</p>


          <ul>
          	<li>We refer to each property/value pair in a ConstraintSet
          		as a 'constraint' (since it is intended to constrain the
          		corresponding Capability of the Constrainable object to 
          		a value that is within the range or list of values it specifies.)</li>
            <li>A set of values for the properties of an object O satisfy
            ConstraintSet C if each value a) is in the set of supported values
            specified by the corresponding Capability of O, and b) is in the
            range or list of values specified by the constraint in C that applies to that property,
            if there is one,
            and c) there is no constraint in C that does not correspond to a
            Capability in O. (Note that although this definition ignores the
            difference between mandatory and optional ConstraintSets, the
            algorithm below distinguishes between them.)</li>


            <li>A ConstraintSet C can be satisifed by an object O if it is
            possible to choose a sequence of values for the properties of O
            that satisfy C.</li>


            <li>To apply a set of ConstraintSet C to object O is to choose such a
            sequence of values that satisfy C and assign them as the settings
            for the properties of O.</li>
          </ul>


          <p>When <code>applyConstraints</code> is called, the UA <em title="must" class=
          "rfc2119">must</em> queue a
          task to run the following steps:</p>


          <ol>
            <li>let <var>desiredContraints</var> be the argument to this
            function. Each constraint <em title="must" class=
          "rfc2119">must</em> specify one or more values (or a
            range of values) for its property. A property <em title="may" class=
          "rfc2119">may</em> appear more than
            once in the list of optional ConstraintSets.</li>


            <li>Let <var>newConstraints</var> be an initially empty list of
            ConstraintSets</li>


            <li>Let <var>object</var> be the Constrainable object on which this
            method was called. Let <var>copy</var> be an unconstrained copy of
            <var>object</var> (i.e., <var>copy</var> should behave as if it
            were <var>object</var> with all ConstraintSets removed.)</li>


            <li>If the mandatory ConstraintSet in <var>desiredConstraints</var>
            is cannot be satisifed by <var>copy</var>, call the
            <code>errorCallback</code>, passing it a new
            <code>MediaError</code> with name
            <code>ConstraintNotSatisfied</code> and <code>constraintName</code>
            set to any of the mandatory constraints that could not be satisfied, and
            return. 
            <code>existingConstraints</code> remain in effect on
            <var>object</var> in this case.</li>


            <li>Otherwise add the mandatory ConstraintSet to
            <var>newConstraints</var></li>


            <li>Iterate over the optional ConstraintSets in
            <var>desiredConstraints</var> in the order in which they were
            specified. For each ConstraintSet,if it and <var>newConstraints</var>
            together can be satisfied by <var>copy</var>, append it to
            <var>newConstraints</var>. Otherwise, ignore it.</li>


            <li>In a single operation, remove all existing ConstraintSets from
            <var>object</var>, apply <var>newConstraints</var>, and fire the
            <code>successCallback</code> passing it <var>newConstraints</var>
            as its argument. From this point on until applyConstraints() is called
            successfully again, getConstraints() <em title="must" class=

            properties of <var>object</var> at any time, as long as the
            resulting set of values satisfy the current set of

        be a corresponding registry that defines the constrainable properties
        of that class of object. The registry entries <em title="must" class=
          "rfc2119">must</em> contain the name of
        each property along with its set of legal values. The registry for
        MediaStreamTrack is defined <a href="#sec-constraints">below</a>. The
        syntax for the specification of the set of legal values depends on the
        type of the values. In addition to the standard atomic types (boolean,
        int, float, DOMString), legal values include lists of any of the atomic
        types, plus min-max ranges, as defined below.</p>

 <p>List values <em title="must" class=

        that 'foo' can have the value 4, the value 5, or the value 6. Similarly
        a <a>Constraint</a> restricting 'foo' to 4,6 would mean that the UA

            ignore if they cannot be satisfied. The order of these ConstraintSets
            is significant. In particular, when they are passed as an argument

            of C1 and C2 is first in this list will be satisfied, and the other

        <p>Each property of a <a href="constraintset">ConstraintSet</a> corresponds to a

        A given
        property MAY occur both in the mandatory and the optional ConstraintSets

<p>
In ECMAScript, ConstraintSet objects are represented using regular native 
objects with optional properties whose names <em title="must" class=
          "rfc2119">must</em> match a Capability
of the Constrainable object.  The conversion from an ECMAScript value, 
representing a ConstraintSet, to an IDL ConstraintSet <em title="must" class=

property name in the ECMAScript value does not match any of the Capabilities
of the Constrainable object.
</p>

<p>
In ECMAScript, all the properties of the ConstraintSet object are optional; 
the developer may specify any of these properties when creating the object. 
But, as described by the conversion rule above, unknown property names will 
fail the conversion to a IDL ConstraintSet.

      <dt> EchoCancelation </dt>

      <dd> <p> This is a enum type constraint that can take the values "true"
        and "false". The default is a non mandatory "true". </p>

        <p> When one or more audio streams is being played in the proceses of
        varios microphones, it is often desirable to attempt to remove the sound
        being played from the input signals recorded by the microphones. This is
        referred to echo cancelation. There are cases where it is not needed and
        it is desirable to turn it off so that no audio artifacts are
        introduced. This constraint allows the application to control this
        behavior. </p>
      </dd>

      <dt> CaptureAudio </dt>

      <dd> <p> This is a enum type constraint that can take the values "true"
        and "false". The default is a non mandatory "true". </p>

        <p> Indicates that application would like to capture audio input from a
        microphone. </p>
      </dd>

      <dt> CaptureVideo </dt>

      <dd> <p> This is a enum type constraint that can take the values "true"
        and "false". The default is a non mandatory "true". </p>

        <p> Indicates that application would like to capture video input from a
        camera. </p>
      </dd>

      <dt> CaptureImage </dt>

      <dd> <p> This is a enum type constraint that can take the values "true"
        and "false". The default is a non mandatory "true". </p>

        <p> Indicates that application would like to capture an single image from a
        camera. </p>
      </dd>


        <dt> EnableSecureMedia </dt>

      <dd> <p> This is a enum type constraint that can take the values "true"
        and "false". The default is a non mandatory "false". </p>

        <p> Indicates that application would like the browser to keep the media
        secure. This means that the media will not be a available to JavaScript
        application but is useful for cases where other objects will operate on
        the media stream. For some trusted application environments, the browser
        may enforce that this constraint is a mandatory "true". </p> </dd>
