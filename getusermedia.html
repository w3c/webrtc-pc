      <p>This document is not complete. It is subject to major changes and,

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Access to multimedia streams (video, audio, or both) from local
      devices (video cameras, microphones, Web cams) can have a number of
      uses, such as real-time communication, recording, and surveillance.</p>

      <p>This document defines the APIs used to get access to local devices
      that can generate multimedia stream data. This document also defines the
      MediaStream API by which JavaScript is able to manipulate the stream
      data or otherwise process it.</p>

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a
      single product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces
      that it contains.</p>

      <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may
      be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent.
      (In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are
      intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>

      <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
      this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
      ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]], as
      this specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>A source is the "thing" providing the source of a media stream
          track. The source is the broadcaster of the media itself. A source
          can be a physical webcam, microphone, local video or audio file from
          the user's hard drive, network resource, or static image.</p>

          <p>Some sources have an identifier which <em class="rfc2119"
          title="must">must</em> be unique to the application (un-guessable by
          another application) and persistent between application sessions
          (e.g., the identifier for a given source device/application must
          stay the same, but not be guessable by another application). Sources
          that must have an identifier are camera and microphone sources;
          local file sources are not required to have an identifier. Source
          identifiers let the application save, identify the availability of,
          and directly request specific sources.</p>

          <p>Other than the identifier, other bits of source identity are
          <strong>never</strong> directly available to the application until
          the user agent connects a source to a track. Once a source has been
          "released" to the application (either via a permissions UI,
          pre-configured allow-list, or some other release mechanism) the
          application will be able discover additional source-specific
          capabilities.</p>

          <p>Sources <strong>do not</strong> have constraints -- tracks have
          constraints. When a source is connected to a track, it must,
          possibly in combination with UA processing (e.g., downsampling),
          conform to the constraints present on that track (or set of
          tracks).</p>

          <p>Sources will be released (un-attached) from a track when the
          track is ended for any reason.</p>

          <p>On the <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> object, sources are represented by a <code>
              <a>sourceType</a>
            </code> attribute. The behavior of APIs associated with the
          source's capabilities and settings change depending on the source
          type.</p>

          <p>Sources have <code>
              <a>capabilities</a>
            </code> and <code>
              <a>settings</a>
            </code>. The capabilities and settings are "owned" by the source
          and are common to any (multiple) tracks that happen to be using the
          same source (e.g., if two different track objects bound to the same
          source ask for the same capability or setting information, they will
          get back the same answer).</p>
        </dd>

        <dt> <a>Setting</a> (Source Setting) </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>A setting refers to the immediate, current value of the source's
          (optionally constrained) capabilities. Settings are always
          read-only.</p>

          <p>A source's settings can change dynamically over time due to
          environmental conditions, sink configurations, or constraint
          changes. A source's settings must always conform to the current set
          of mandatory constraints that all of the tracks it is bound to have
          defined, and should do its best to conform to the set of optional
          constraints specified.</p>

          <p>Although settings are a property of the source, they are only
          exposed to the application through the tracks attached to the
          source. The <a>ConstrainablePattern</a> interface provides this
          exposure.</p>

          <p>A conforming user-agent <em class="rfc2119"
          title="must">must</em> support all the setting names defined in this
          spec.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <a>Capabilities</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Source capabilities are the intrinsic "features" of a source
          object. For each source setting, there is a corresponding capability
          that describes whether it is supported by the source and if so, what
          the range of supported values are. As with settings, capabilities
          are exposed to the application via the <a>ConstrainablePattern</a>
          interface.</p>

          <p>The values of the supported capabilities must be normalized to
          the ranges and enumerated types defined in this specification.</p>

          <p>A <a>getCapabilities()</a> call on a track returns the same
          underlying per-source capabilities for all tracks connected to the
          source.</p>

          <p>Source capabilities are effectively constant. Applications should
          be able to depend on a specific source having the same capabilities
          for any session.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
          <a>Constraints</a>
        </dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Constraints are an optional track feature for restricting the
          range of allowed variability on a source. Without provided track
          constraints, implementations are free to select a source's settings
          from the full ranges of its supported capabilities, and to adjust
          those settings at any time for any reason.</p>

          <p>Constraints are exposed on tracks via the
          <a>ConstrainablePattern</a> interface, which includes an API for
          dynamically changing constraints. Note that <a>getUserMedia()</a>
          also permits an initial set of constraints to be applied when the
          track is first obtained.</p>

          <p>It is possible for two tracks that share a unique source to apply
          contradictory constraints. The <a>ConstrainablePattern</a> interface
          supports the calling of an error handler when the conflicting
          constraint is requested. After successful application of constraints
          on a track (and its associated source), if at any later time the
          track becomes <a>overconstrained</a>, the user agent MUST change the
          track to the <a>muted</a> state.</p>

          <p>A correspondingly-named constraint exists for each corresponding
          source setting name and capability name. In general, user agents
          will have more flexibility to optimize the media streaming
          experience the fewer constraints are applied, so application authors
          are strongly encouraged to use mandatory constraints sparingly.</p>

      <h2>MediaStream API</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>The two main components in the MediaStream API are the <code>
            <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
          </code> and the <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> interfaces. The <code>
            <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
          </code> object represents media originating from a single media
        source in the user agent, e.g. video from a web camera. A <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> is used group several <code>
            <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
          </code> objects into one unit that can be rendered in a media
        element or recorded.</p>

        <p>Each <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> can contain zero or more <code>
            <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
          </code> objects. All tracks in a <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> are intended to be synchronized when rendered. Different
        <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> objects do not need to be synchronized.</p>

        <p class="note">While the intent is to synchronize tracks, it could be
        better in some circumstances to permit tracks to lose
        synchronization.In particular, when tracks are remotely sourced and
        real-time [[!WEBRTC10]], it can be better to allow loss of
        synchronization than to accumulate delays or risk glitches and other
        artifacts. Implementations are expected to understand the implications
        of choices regarding synchronization of playback and the effect that
        these have on user perception.</p>

        <p>A <code>
            <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
          </code> represents content comprising one or more channels, where
        the channels have a defined well known relationship to each other
        (such as a stereo or 5.1 audio signal). A channel is the smallest unit
        considered in this API specification.</p>

        <p>
          <img alt="A MediaStream" src="images/media-stream.png" width="418" />
        </p>

        <p>A <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> object has an input and an output that represent the
        combined input and output of all the object's tracks. The output of
        the <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> controls how the object is rendered, e.g., what is saved if
        the object is recorded to a file or what is displayed if the object is
        used in a <code>video</code> element.</p>

        <p>A new <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> object can be created from accessible media sources (that
        does not require any additional permissions) using the <code>
            <a href="#dom-mediastream">MediaStream()</a>
          </code> constructor. The constructor argument can either be an
        existing <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> object, in which case all the tracks of the given stream are
        added to the new <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> object, or an array of <code>
            <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
          </code> objects. The latter form makes it possible to compose a
        stream from different source streams.</p>

        <p>Both <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> and <code>
            <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
          </code> objects can be cloned. This allows for greater control since
        the separate instances can be manipulated and <a
        title="consumer">consumed</a> individually. A cloned <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> contains clones of all member tracks from the original
        stream.</p>

        <p>When a <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> object is being generated from a local file (as opposed to a
        live audio/video source), the user agent SHOULD stream the data from
        the file in real time, not all at once. The <code>MediaStream</code>
        object is also used in contexts outside <code>getUserMedia</code>,
        such as [[!WEBRTC10]]. In both cases, ensuring a realtime stream
        reduces the ease with which pages can distinguish live video from
        pre-recorded video, which can help protect the user's privacy.</p>

        <p>The <dfn id="dom-mediastream">
            <code>MediaStream()</code>
          </dfn> constructor composes a new stream out of existing tracks. It
        takes an optional argument of type <code>

          </code> or an array of <code>
            <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
          </code> objects. <dfn id="mediastream-constructor">When the

        <p>The tracks of a <code>

          </code> objects that correspond to the tracks of the stream. The
        relative order of the tracks in the set is user agent defined and the
        API will never put any requirements on the order. The proper way to
        find a specific <code>
            <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
          </code> object in the set is to look it up by its <code>
            <a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-id">id</a>

        <p>An object that reads data from the output of a <code>

        <p class="note"><code>

        <p>A <code>

            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> can start its life as inactive if it is constructed without
        any tracks.</p>

        <p>When a <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> goes from being active to inactive, the user agent MUST

            <a href="#dom-mediastream-active">active</a>
          </code> attribute to <code>false</code> and fire a simple event
        named <code>
            <a href="#event-mediastream-inactive">inactive</a>
          </code> at the object. When a <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> goes from being inactive to active, the user agent MUST
        queue a task that sets the object's <code>
            <a href="#dom-mediastream-active">active</a>
          </code> attribute to <code>true</code> and fire a simple event named
        <code>
            <a href="#event-mediastream-active">active</a>
          </code> at the object.</p>

        <p>If the stream's activity status changed due to a user request, the
        task source for this <span title="concept-task">task</span> is the
        user interaction task source. Otherwise the task source for this <span

        <h2>MediaStreamTrack</h2>

        <p>A <code>
            <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
          </code> object represents a media source in the user agent. Several
        <code>
            <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
          </code> objects can represent the same media source, e.g., when the
        user chooses the same camera in the UI shown by two consecutive calls
        to <code>
            <a href="#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a>
          </code> .</p>

        <p>The data from a <code>
            <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
          </code> object does not necessarily have a canonical binary form;
        for example, it could just be "the video currently coming from the
        user's video camera". This allows user agents to manipulate media in
        whatever fashion is most suitable on the user's platform.</p>

        <p>A script can indicate that a track no longer needs its source with
        the <code>
            <a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-stop">MediaStreamTrack.stop()</a>
          </code> method. When all tracks using a source have been stopped,
        the given permission for that source is revoked and the source is <dfn
        id="source-stopped">stopped</dfn>. If the data is being generated from
        a live source (e.g., a microphone or camera), then the user agent
        SHOULD remove any active "on-air" indicator for that source. If the
        data is being generated from a prerecorded source (e.g. a video file),
        any remaining content in the file is ignored. An implementation may
        use a per source reference count to keep track of source usage, but
        the specifics are out of scope for this specification.</p>

        <p>If there is no stored permission to use that source, the UA SHOULD
        also remove the "permission granted" indicator for the source.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Life-cycle and Media Flow</h3>

          <h4>Life-cycle</h4>

          <p>A <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> has two stages in its life-cycle: <code>live</code> and
          <code>ended</code>. A newly created <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> can be in any stage depending on how it was created. For
          example, cloning an ended track results in a new ended track. The
          current stage is reflected by the object's <code>
              <a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-readystate">readyState</a>
            </code> attribute.</p>

          <p>In the <code>live</code> state, the track is active and media is
          available for use by consumers (but may be replaced by
          zero-information-content if the <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> is <a href="#track-muted">muted</a> or <a
          href="#track-enabled">enabled</a>, see below).</p>

          <p>A muted or disabled <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> renders either silence (audio), black frames (video), or a
          zero-information-content equivalent. For example, a video element
          sourced by a muted or disabled <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> (contained within a <code>
              <a>MediaStream</a>
            </code>), is playing but the rendered content is the muted output.
          When all tracks connected to a source are muted or disabled, the
          "on-air" or "recording" indicator for that source can be turned off;
          when the track is no longer muted or disabled, it MUST be turned
          back on.</p>

          <p>The muted/unmuted state of a track reflects if the source
          provides any media at this moment. The enabled/disabled state is
          under application control and determines if the track outputs media
          (to its consumers). Hence, media from the source only flows when a
          <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> object is both unmuted and enabled.</p>

          <p>A <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> is <dfn id="track-muted">muted</dfn> when the source is
          temporarily unable to provide the track with data. A track can be
          muted by a user. Often this action is outside the control of the
          application. This could be as a result of the user hitting a
          hardware switch, or toggling a control in the operating system or
          browser chrome. A track can also be muted by the user agent.</p>

          <p>Applications are able to <dfn id="track-enabled">enable</dfn> or
          disable a <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> to prevent it from rendering media from the source. A
          muted track will however, regardless of the enabled state, render
          silence and blackness. A disabled track is logically equivalent to a
          muted track, from a consumer point of view.</p>

          <p>For a newly created <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> object, the following applies. The track is always enabled
          unless stated otherwise (for example when cloned) and the muted
          state reflects the state of the source at the time the track is
          created.</p>

          <p>A <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> object is said to <em>end</em> when the source of the
          track is disconnected or exhausted.</p>

          <p>A <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> can be <dfn id="track-detached">detached</dfn> from its
          source. It means that the track is no longer dependent on the source
          for media data. If no other <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> is using the same source, the source will be <a
          href="#source-stopped">stopped</a>. <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> attributes such as <code>
              <a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-kind">kind</a>
            </code> and <code>

          <p>When a <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> object ends for any reason (e.g., because the user
          rescinds the permission for the page to use the local camera, or
          because the data comes from a finite file and the file's end has
          been reached and the user has not requested that it be looped, or
          because the application invoked the <code>
              <a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-stop">stop()</a>
            </code> method on the <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> object, or because the UA has instructed the track to end
          for any reason) it is said to be <dfn
          id="track-ended">ended</dfn>.</p>

          <p>When a <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> <var>track</var> ends for any reason other than the <code>
              <a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-stop">stop()</a>
            </code> method being invoked, the user agent MUST queue a task
          that runs the following steps:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>If the <var>track's</var> <code>
                  <a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-readystate">readyState</a>
                </code> attribute has the value <code>ended</code> already,
              then abort these steps.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Set <var>track's</var> <code>
                  <a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-readystate">readyState</a>
                </code> attribute to <code>ended</code>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p><a href="#track-detached">Detach</a> <var>track's</var>
              source.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Fire a simple event named <code>
                  <a href="#event-mediastreamtrack-ended">ended</a>
                </code> at the object.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>If the end of the stream was reached due to a user request, the
          event source for this event is the user interaction event
          source.</p>

          <h4>Media Flow</h4>

          <p>There are two concepts related to the media flow for a
          <code>live</code> <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code>: muted or not, and enabled or disabled.</p>

          <p><dfn id="track-muted">Muted</dfn> refers to the input to the
          <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code>. If live samples are not made available to the <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> it is muted.</p>

          <p>Muted is out of control for the application, but can be observed
          by the application by reading the <code>
              <a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-muted">muted</a>
            </code> attribute and listening to the associated events <code>
              <a href="#event-mediastreamtrack-mute">mute</a>
            </code> and <code>
              <a href="#event-mediastreamtrack-unmute">unmute</a>
            </code>.There can be several reasons for a <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> to be muted: the user pushing a physical mute button on
          the microphone, the user toggling a control in the operating system,
          the user clicking a mute button in the browser chrome, the UA (on
          behalf of the user) mutes, etc.</p>

          <p><dfn id="track-enabled">Enabled/disabled</dfn> on the other hand
          is available to application to control (and observe) via the <code>
              <a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-enabled">enabled</a>
            </code> attribute.</p>

          <p>The result for the consumer is the same in the meaning that
          whenever <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> is muted or disabled (or both) the consumer gets
          zero-information-content, which means silence for audio and black
          frames for video. In other words, media from the source only flows
          when a <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> object is both unmuted and enabled. For example, a video
          element sourced by a muted or disabled <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> (contained in a <code>
              <a>MediaStream</a>
            </code>), is playing but rendering blackness.</p>

          <p>For a newly created <code>
              <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
            </code> object, the following applies: the track is always enabled
          unless stated otherwise (for example when cloned) and the muted
          state reflects the state of the source at the time the track is
          created.</p>

          <h3>Tracks and Constraints</h3>

          <p>Constraints are set on tracks and may affect sources.</p>

          <p>Whether <code>
              <a>Constraints</a>
            </code> were provided at track initialization time or need to be
          established later at runtime, the APIs defined in the
          <a>ConstrainablePattern</a> Interface allow the retrieval and
          manipulation of the constraints currently established on a
          track.</p>

          <p>Each track maintains an internal version of the <code>
              <a>Constraints</a>
            </code> structure, namely a mandatory set of constraints (no
          duplicates), and an optional ordered list of individual constraint
          objects (may contain duplicates). The internal stored constraint
          structure is exposed to the application by the <code>
              <a>constraints</a>
            </code> attribute, and may be modified by the <code>
              <a>applyConstraints()</a>
            </code> method.</p>

          <p>When <code>
              <a>applyConstraints()</a>
            </code> is called, a user agent MUST queue a task to evaluate
          those changes when the task queue is next serviced. Similarly, if
          the <a>
              <code>sourceType</code>
            </a> changes, then the user agent MUST perform the same actions to
          re-evaluate the constraints of each track affected by that source
          change.</p>

          <p>If the <code>
              <a>MediaStreamError</a>
            </code> event named 'overconstrained' is thrown, the track MUST be
          muted until either new satisfiable constraints are applied or the
          existing constraints become satisfiable.</p>

      <h2>The model: sources, sinks, constraints, and settings</h2>

      <p>Browsers provide a media pipeline from sources to sinks. In a
      browser, sinks are the &lt;img&gt;, &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt;
      tags. Traditional sources include streamed content, files, and web
      resources. The media produced by these sources typically does not change
      over time - these sources can be considered to be static.</p>

      <p>The sinks that display these sources to the user (the actual tags
      themselves) have a variety of controls for manipulating the source
      content. For example, an &lt;img&gt; tag scales down a huge source image
      of 1600x1200 pixels to fit in a rectangle defined with
      <code>width="400"</code> and <code>height="300"</code>.</p>

      <p>The getUserMedia API adds dynamic sources such as microphones and
      cameras - the characteristics of these sources can change in response to
      application needs. These sources can be considered to be dynamic in
      nature. A &lt;video&gt; element that displays media from a dynamic
      source can either perform scaling or it can feed back information along
      the media pipeline and have the source produce content more suitable for
      display.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This sort of feedback loop is obviously just
        enabling an "optimization", but it's a non-trivial gain. This
        optimization can save battery, allow for less network congestion,
        etc...</p>
      </div>

      <p>Note that <code>MediaStream</code> sinks (such as
      <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>, and even
      <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>) will continue to have mechanisms to
      further transform the source stream beyond that which the
      <a>Settings</a>, <a>Capabilities</a>, and <a>Constraints</a> described
      in this specification offer. (The sink transformation options, including
      those of <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, are outside the scope of this
      specification.)</p>

      <p>The act of changing or applying a track constraint may affect the
      <code>
          <a>settings</a>
        </code> of all tracks sharing that source and consequently all
      down-level sinks that are using that source. Many sinks may be able to
      take these changes in stride, such as the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>
      element or <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>. Others like the Recorder API
      may fail as a result of a source setting change.</p>

      <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> is an interesting object because
      it acts simultaneously as both a sink <strong>and</strong> a source for
      over-the-network streams. As a sink, it has source transformational
      capabilities (e.g., lowering bit-rates, scaling-up or down resolutions,
      adjusting frame-rates), and as a source it could have its own settings
      changed by a track source (though in this specification sources with the
      <code>
          <a>remote</a>
        </code> attribute set to true do not consider the current constraints
      applied to a track).</p>

      <p>To illustrate how changes to a given source impact various sinks,
      consider the following example. This example only uses width and height,
      but the same principles apply to any of the <a>Settings</a> exposed in
      this specification. In the first figure a home client has obtained a
      video source from its local video camera. The source's width and height
      settings are 800 pixels by 600 pixels, respectively. Three <code>
          <a>MediaStream</a>
        </code> objects on the home client contain tracks that use this same
      <code>
          <a>sourceId</a>
        </code>. The three media streams are connected to three different
      sinks: a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element (A), another
      <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element (B), and a peer connection (C). The
      peer connection is streaming the source video to an away client. On the
      away client there are two media streams with tracks that use the peer
      connection as a source. These two media streams are connected to two
      <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element sinks (Y and Z).</p>

      <img alt="Changing media stream source effects: before the requested change"
           src="images/change_states_before.png" />

      <p>Note that at this moment, all of the sinks on the home client must
      apply a transformation to the original source's provided dimension
      settings. A is scaling the video up (resulting in loss of quality), B is
      scaling the video down, and C is also scaling the video up slightly for
      sending over the network. On the away client, sink Y is scaling the
      video way down, while sink Z is not applying any scaling.</p>

      <p>Using the <a>ConstrainablePattern</a> interface, one of the tracks
      requests a higher resolution (1920 by 1200 pixels) from the home
      client's video source.</p>

      <img alt="Changing media stream source     effects: after the requested change"
           src="images/change_states_after.png" />

      <p>Note that the source change immediately affects all of the tracks and
      sinks on the home client, but does not impact any of the sinks (or
      sources) on the away client. With the increase in the home client source
      video's dimensions, sink A no longer has to perform any scaling, while
      sink B must scale down even further than before. Sink C (the peer
      connection) must now scale down the video in order to keep the
      transmission constant to the away client.</p>

      <p>While not shown, an equally valid settings change request could be
      made of the away client video source (the peer connection on the away
      client's side). This would not only impact sink Y and Z in the same
      manner as before, but could lead to re-negotiation with the peer
      connection on the home client in order to alter the transformation that
      it is applying to the home client's video source. Such a change is NOT
      REQUIRED to change anything related to sink A or B or the home client's
      video source.</p>

      <p>Note that this specification does not define a mechanism by which a
      change to the away client's video source could automatically trigger a
      change to the home client's video source. Implementations may choose to
      make such source-to-sink optimizations as long as they only do so within
      the constraints established by the application, as the next example
      demonstrates.</p>

      <p>It is fairly obvious that changes to a given source will impact sink
      consumers. However, in some situations changes to a given sink may also
      be cause for implementations to adjust a source's settings. This is
      illustrated in the following figures. In the first figure below, the
      home client's video source is sending a video stream sized at 1920 by
      1200 pixels. The video source is also unconstrained, such that the exact
      source dimensions are flexible as far as the application is concerned.
      Two <code>
          <a>MediaStream</a>
        </code> objects contain tracks with the same <code>
          <a>sourceId</a>
        </code>, and those <code>
          <a>MediaStream</a>
        </code>s are connected to two different <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>
      element sinks A and B. Sink A has been sized to
      <code>width="1920"</code> and <code>height="1200"</code> and is
      displaying the source's video content without any transformations. Sink
      B has been sized smaller and, as a result, is scaling the video down to
      fit its rectangle of 320 pixels across by 200 pixels down.</p>

      <img alt="Changing media stream sinks may affect sources: before the requested change"
           src="images/change_states_before2.png" />

      <p>When the application changes sink A to a smaller dimension (from 1920
      to 1024 pixels wide and from 1200 to 768 pixels tall), the browser's
      media pipeline may recognize that none of its sinks require the higher
      source resolution, and needless work is being done both on the part of
      the source and on sink A. In such a case and without any other
      constraints forcing the source to continue producing the higher
      resolution video, the media pipeline MAY change the source
      resolution:</p>

      <img alt="Changing media stream sinks may affect sources: after the requested change"
           src="images/change_states_after2.png" />

      <p>In the above figure, the home client's video source resolution was
      changed to the greater of that from sinkA and from sinkB in order to
      optimize playback. While not shown above, the same behavior could apply
      to peer connections and other sinks.</p>

      <p>It is possible that <a>constraints</a> can be applied to a track
      which a source is unable to satisfy, either because the source itself
      cannot satisfy the constraint or because the source is already
      satisfying a conflicting constraint. When this happens, the <code>
          <a>applyConstraints()</a>
        </code> call will fail and call the user-provided
      <a>ConstraintErrorCallback</a>, without applying any of the new
      constraints. Since no change in constraints occurs in this case, there
      is also no required change to the source itself as a result of this
      condition. Here is an example of this behavior.</p>

      <p>In this example, two media streams each have a video track that share
      the same source. The first track initially has no constraints applied.
      It is connected to sink N. Sink N has a width and height of 800 by 600
      pixels and is scaling down the source's resolution of 1024 by 768 to
      fit. The other track has a mandatory constraint forcing off the source's
      fill light; it is connected to sink P. Sink P has a width and height
      equal to that of the source.</p>

      <p>
        <img alt="Overconstrained application"
             src="images/overconstrained_apply.png" />
      </p>

      <p>Now, the first track adds a mandatory constraint that the fill light
      should be forced on. At this point, both mandatory constraints cannot be
      satisfied by the source (the fill light cannot be simultaneously on and
      off at the same time). Since this state was caused by the first track's
      attempt to apply a conflicting constraint, the constraint application
      fails and there is no change in the source's settings or the constraints
      on either track.</p>

      <p>Let's look at a slightly different situation starting from the same
      point. In this case, instead of the first track attempting to apply a
      conflicting constraint, the user physically locks the camera into a mode
      where the fill light is on. At this point the source can no longer
      satisfy the second track's mandatory constraint that the fill light be
      off. The second track is transitioned into the muted state and receives
      an <a>overconstrained</a> event. At the same time, the source notes that
      its remaining active sink only requires a resolution of 800 by 600 and
      so it adjusts its resolution down to match (this is an optional
      optimization that the user agent is allowed to make given the
      situation).</p>

      <p>
        <img alt="Overconstrained occurrence"
             src="images/overconstrained_occurrence.png" />
      </p>

      <p>At this point, it is the responsibility of the application to address
      the problem that led to the overconstrained situation, perhaps by
      removing the fill light mandatory constraint on the second track or by
      closing the second track altogether and informing the user</p>

      <h2>MediaStreams as Media Elements</h2>

      <p>A <code>MediaStream</code> may be assigned to media elements as
      defined in <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#media-elements">HTML5</a>
      [[HTML5]] A <code>MediaStream</code> is not preloadable or seekable and
      represents a simple, potentially infinite, linear media timeline. The
      timeline starts at 0 and increments linearly in real time as long as the
      <code>MediaStream</code> is playing. The timeline does not increment
      when the <code>MediaStream</code> is paused.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Direct Assignment to Media Elements</h3>

        <p>UAs that support this specification MUST support the following
        partial interface, which allows a MediaStream to be assigned directly
        to a media element.</p>

        <dl class="idl" title="partial interface HTMLMediaElement">
          <dt>attribute MediaStream? srcObject</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Holds the MediaStream that provides media for this element.
            This attribute overrides both the <code>src</code> attribute and
            any &lt;source&gt; elements. Specifically, if
            <code>srcObject</code> is specified, the UA MUST use it as the
            source of media, even if the <code>src</code> attribute is also
            set or &lt;source&gt; children are present. If the value of
            <code>srcObject</code> is replaced or set to null the UA MUST
            re-run the <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#media-element-load-algorithm">
            media element load algorithm</a></p>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p class="issue">We may want to allow direct assignment of other types

      <section>
        <h3>Loading and Playing a MediaStream in a Media Element</h3>

        <p>The UA runs the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#media-element-load-algorithm">
        media element load algorithm</a> to obtain media for the media element
        to display. As defined in the [[HTML5]] specification, this algorithm
        has two basic phases: <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#concept-media-load-algorithm">
        resource selection algorithm</a> chooses the resource to play and
        resolves its URI. Then the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#concept-media-load-resource">
        resource fetch phase</a> loads the resource. Both these phases are
        potentially simplified when using a MediaStream. First of all,
        <code>srcObject</code> takes priority over other means of specifying
        the resource, and it provides the object itself rather than a URI.
        Therefore, there is no need to run the resource selection algorithm.
        Secondly, when the UA reaches the resource fetch algorithm with a
        MediaStream, the MediaStream is a local object so there's nothing to
        fetch. Therefore, the following modifications/restrictions to the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#media-element-load-algorithm">
        media element load algorithm</a> apply:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Whenever the user agent runs the <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#media-element-load-algorithm">
            media element load algorithm</a>, if <code>srcObject</code> is
            specified, the UA must immediately go to the <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#concept-media-load-resource">
            resource fetch phase</a> of the algorithm.</p>

          reservation</span>

          <p class="practicedesc">The user agent is encouraged to reserve
          resources when it has determined that a given call to <a
          href="#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a> will
          succeed. It is preferable to reserve the resource prior to invoking
          the success callback provided by the web page. Subsequent calls to
          <a href="#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a> (in this
          page or any other) should treat the resource that was previously
          allocated, as well as resources held by other applications, as busy.
          Resources marked as busy should not be provided as sources to the
          current web page, unless specified by the user. Optionally, the user
          agent may choose to provide a stream sourced from a busy source but
          only to a page whose origin matches the owner of the original stream
          that is keeping the source busy.</p>

          <p class="practicedesc">This document recommends that in the
          permission grant dialog or device selection interace (if one
          is present), the user be allowed to select any available
          hardware as a source for the stream requested by the page
          (provided the resource is able to fulfill mandatory
          constraints, if any were specified).  Although not
          specifically recommended as best practice, note that some
          user agents may support the ability to substitute a video or
          audio source with local files and other media. A file picker
          may be used to provide this functionality to the user.</p>

          <p class="practicedesc">This document also recommends that the user
          be shown all resources that are currently busy as a result of prior
          calls to <a href="#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a>
          (in this page or any other page that is still alive) and be allowed
          to terminate that stream and utilize the resource for the current
          page instead. If possible in the current operating environment, it
          is also suggested that resources currently held by other
          applications be presented and treated in the same manner. If the
          user chooses this option, the track corresponding to the resource
          that was provided to the page whose stream was affected must be
          removed.</p>

          <p class="practicedesc">A <a>MediaStream</a> may contain more than
          one video and audio track. This makes it possible to include video
          from two or more webcams in a single stream object, for example.
          However, the current API does not allow a page to express a need for
          multiple video streams from independent sources.</p>

          <p class="practicedesc">It is recommended for multiple calls to <a
          href="#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a> from the

          times before reaching a stable state, this document advises the UI
          designer that the permission dialogs should be merged, so that the
          user can give permission for the use of multiple cameras and/or
          media sources in one dialog interaction. The constraints on each

      <h2>Constrainable Pattern</h2>

      <p>The Constrainable pattern allows its consumers to inspect and adjust
      the properties of the object that implements it. It is broken out as a
      separate set of definitions so that it can be referred to by other
      specifications. The core concept is that of a Capability, which consists
      of a property or feature of an object and the set of its possible
      values, which may be specified either as a range or as an enumeration.
      For example, a camera might be capable of framerates (a property)
      between 20 and 50 frames per second (a range) and may be able to be
      positioned (a property) facing towards the user, away from the user, or
      to the left or right of the user (an enumerated set.) The application
      can examine a ConstrainablePattern object's set of Capabilities via the
      <code>getCapabilities()</code> accessor.</p>

      <p>The application can select the (range of) values it wants for an
      object's Capabilities by means of basic and/or advanced ConstraintSets
      and the <code>applyConstraints()</code> method. A ConstraintSet consists
      of the names of one or more properties of the object plus the desired
      value (or a range of desired values) for each of them. Each of those
      property/value pairs can be considered to be an individual constraint.
      For example, the application may set a ConstraintSet containing two
      constraints, the first stating that the framerate of a camera be between
      30 and 40 frames per second (a range) and the second that the camera
      should be facing the user (a specific value). How the individual
      constraints interact depends on whether and how they are given in the
      basic Constraint structure, which is a ConstraintSet with an additional
      'advanced' property, or whether they are in a ConstraintSet in the
      advanced list. The behavior is as follows: all 'min', 'max', and 'exact'
      constraints in the basic Constraint structure are together treated as
      the 'required' set, and if it is not possible to satisfy simultaneously
      all of those individual constraints for tho indicated property names,
      the UA MUST call the <code>errorCallback</code>. Otherwise, it must
      apply the required constraints. Next, it will consider any
      ConstraintSets given in the 'advanced' list, in the order in which they
      are specified, and will try to satisfy/apply each complete ConstraintSet
      (i.e., all constraints in the ConstraintSet together), but will skip a
      ConstraintSet if and only if it cannot satisfy/apply it in its entirety.
      Next, the UA MUST attempt to apply, individually, any 'ideal' constraint
      or a constraint given as a bare value for the property. Of these
      properties, it MUST satisfy the largest number that it can, in any
      order. Finally, the UA MUST call the <code>successCallback</code>.</p>

      <p>Important note: If JavaScript applications using this API want the
      attributes in the constraints to be used by the browser, the JavaScript
      code has to first check, via <code>getSupportedConstraints()</code>,
      that all the named properties that are used are supported by the
      browser. The reason for this is that WebIDL drops any unsupported names
      from the dictionary holding the constraints, so the browser does not see
      them and the unsupported names end up being silently ignored. This will
      cause confusing programming errors as the JavaScript code will be
      setting constraints but the browser will be ignoring them. Browsers that
      support (recognize) the name of a required constraint but cannot satisfy
      it will generate an error, while browsers that do not support the given
      name of the constraint will not generate an error. </p>

      <p class="issue">The definition and behavior of 'ideal', along with that
      of bare values in the basic constraint structure (which are assumed to
      mean 'ideal'), have not yet been agreed upon, or even thoroughly
      discussed.</p>

      <p>The following examples may help to understand how constraints work.
      The first shows a basic Constraint structure. Three constraints are
      given, each of which the UA will attempt to satisfy individually.
      Depending upon the resolutions available for this camera, it is possible
      that not all three constraints can be satisfied at the same time. If so,
      the user agent will satisfy two if it can, or only one if not even two
      constraints can be satisfied together. Note that if not all three can be
      satisfied simultaneously, it is possible that there is more than one
      combination of two constraints that could be satisfied. If so, the user
      agent will choose.</p>

      <pre class="example highlight" xml:space="preserve">
var supports = navigator.mediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints("video");
if(!supports["aspectRatio"]) {
  // Treat like an error.
}
 var constraints =
  {
    width: 1280,
    height: 720,
    aspectRatio: 1.5
  };
</pre>

      <p>This next example adds a small bit of complexity. The ideal values
      are still given for width and height, but this time with minimum
      requirements on each as well that must be satisfied. If it cannot
      satisfy either the width or height minimum it will call the
      <code>errorCallback</code>. Otherwise, it will try to satisfy the width,
      height, and aspectRatio target values as well and then call the
      <code>successCallback</code>.</p>

      <pre class="example highlight" xml:space="preserve">
var supports = navigator.mediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints("video");
if(!supports["aspectRatio"]) {
  // Treat like an error.
}
 var constraints =
  {
    width: {min: 640, ideal: 1280},
    height: {min: 480, ideal: 720},
    aspectRatio: 1.5
  };
</pre>

      <p>This example illustrates the full control possible with the
      Constraints structure by adding the 'advanced' property. In this case,
      the user agent behaves the same way with respect to the required
      constraints, but before attempting to satisfy the ideal values it will
      process the 'advanced' list. In this example the 'advanced' list
      contains two ConstraintSets. The first specifies width and height
      constraints, and the second specifies an aspectRatio constraint. Note
      that in the advanced list, these bare values are treated as 'exact'
      values. This example represents the following: "I need my video to be at
      least 640 pixels wide and at least 480 pixels high. My preference is for
      precisely 1920x1280, but if you can't give me that, give me an
      aspectRatio of 4x3 if at all possible. If even that is not possible,
      give me a resolution as close to 1280x720 as possieble."</p>

      <pre class="example highlight" xml:space="preserve">
var supports = navigator.mediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints("video");
if(!supports["width"] || !supports["height"]) {
  // Treat like an error.
}
 var constraints =
  {
    width: {min: 640, ideal: 1280},
    height: {min: 480, ideal: 720},
    advanced: [{width: 1920, height: 1280},
               {aspectRatio: 1.3333333333}]
  };
</pre>

      <p>The ordering of advanced ConstraintSets is significant. In the
      preceding example it is impossible to satisfy both the 1920x1280
      ConstraintSet and the 4x3 aspect ratio ConstraintSet at the same time.
      Since the 1920x1280 occurs first in the list, the user agent will
      attempt to satisfy it first. Application authors can therefore implement
      a backoff strategy by specifying multiple optional ConstraintSets for
      the same property. For example, an application might specify three
      optional ConstraintSets, the first asking for a framerate greater than
      500, the second asking for a framerate greater than 400, and the third
      asking for one greater than 300. If the UA is capable of setting a
      framerate greater than 500, it will (and the subsequent two
      ConstraintSets will be trivially satisfied.) However, if the UA cannot
      set the framerate above 500, it will skip that ConstraintSet and attempt
      to set the framerate above 400. If that fails, it will then try to set
      it above 300. If the UA cannot satisfy any of the three ConstraintSets,
      it will set the framerate to any value it can get. If the developer
      wanted to insist on 300 as a lower bound, he could provide that as a
      'min' value in the basic ConstraintSet. In that case, the UA would fail
      altogether if it couldn't get a value over 300, but would choose a value
      over 500 if possible, then try for a value over 400.</p>

      <p>Note that, unlike basic constraints, the constraints within a
      ConstraintSet in the advanced list must be satisfied together or skipped
      together. Thus, {width: 1920, height: 1280} is a request for that
      specific resolution, not a request for that width or that height. One
      can think of the basic constraints as requesting an or (non-exclusive)
      of the individual constraints, while each advanced ConstraintSet is
      requesting an and of the individual constraints in the ConstraintSet. An
      application may inspect the full set of Constraints currently in effect
      via the <code>getConstraints()</code> accessor.</p>

      <p>The specific value that the UA chooses for a Capability is referred
      to as a Setting. For example, if the application applies a ConstraintSet
      specifying that the framerate must be at least 30 frames per second, and
      no greater than 40, the Setting can be any intermediate value, e.g., 32,
      35, or 37 frames per second. The application can query the current
      settings of the object's Capabilities via the <code>
          <a>getSettings()</a>
        </code> accessor.</p>

        <h2>Interface Definition</h2>

        <p>Due to the limitations of the interface definition language used in

        or implement ConstrainablePattern. Therefore the WebIDL definitions

        make use of the functionality defined here will have to provide its

        However it can refer to the semantics defined here, which will not
        change. See <a

              <li>We refer to the "effective Capability" C of an object O as
              the possibly proper subset of the possible values of C (as
              returned by getCapabilities) taking into consideration
              environmental limitations and/or restrictions placed by other
              constraints. For example given a ConstraintSet that constrains
              Capabilities aspectRatio, height and width, the values assigned
              to any two of the Capabilities limit the effective Capability of
              the third. The set of effective Capabilities may be platform
              dependent. For example, on a resource-limited device it may not
              be possible to set Capabilities C1 and C2 both to 'high', while
              on another less limited device, this may be possible.</li>

              <li>A set of values for the Capabilities of an object O satisfy
              ConstraintSet CS if each value a) is in the range of the
              corresponding effective Capability of O, and b) is in the range
              or list of values specified by the corresponding constraint in
              CS, if there is one, and c) there is no constraint in CS that
              does not correspond to a Capability of O. (Note that although
              this definition ignores the difference between required and
              optional ConstraintSets, the algorithm below distinguishes
              between them.)</li>

              <li>A set of ConstraintSets CS1...CSn (n &gt;= 1) can be
              satisfied by an object O if it is possible to choose a sequence
              of values for the Capabilities of O that satisfy CS1...CSn
              simultaneously.</li>

              <li>To apply a set of ConstraintSet CS1...CSn to object O is to
              choose such a sequence of values that satisfy CS1...CSn and
              assign them as the settings for the properties of O.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When <code>applyConstraints</code> is called, the UA <em
            class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em> queue a task to run the
            following steps:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>let <var>newContraints</var> be the argument to this
              function. Each constraint <em class="rfc2119"
              title="must">must</em> specify one or more values (or a range of
              values) for its property. A property <em class="rfc2119"
              title="may">may</em> appear more than once in the list of
              'advanced' ConstraintSets. Let <var>requiredConstraints</var> be
              the set of 'min', 'max', and 'exact' constraints appearing in
              <var>newConstraints</var>. Let <var>unorderedConstraints</var>
              be all the other constraints in <var>newConstraints</var>. Note
              that 'advanced' is not a member of either of these sets since it
              represents meta-information about constraints. In the following
              we treat <var>requiredConstraints</var> and
              <var>unorderedConstraints</var> as ConstraintSets. Note that
              unknown properties are discarded by WebIDL, which means that
              unknown/unsupported required constraints will silently
              disappear. To avoid this being a surprise, application authors
              are expected to first use the
              <code>getSupportedConstraints()</code> method as shown in the
              Examples below.</li>

              <li>Let <var>object</var> be the ConstrainablePattern object on
              which this method was called. Let <var>copy</var> be an
              unconstrained copy of <var>object</var> (i.e., <var>copy</var>
              should behave as if it were <var>object</var> with all
              ConstraintSets removed.)</li>

              <li>If <var>requiredConstraints</var> is non-null and cannot be
              satisfied by <var>copy</var>, call the

              <code>ConstraintNotSatisfied</code> and
              <code>constraintName</code> set to any of the required
              constraints that could not be satisfied, and return.
              <var>existingConstraints</var> remain in effect in this
              case.</li>

              <li>Let <var>successfulConstraints</var> be a list of
              ConstraintSets, initially containing only
              <var>requiredConstraints</var>. Iterate over the 'advanced'
              ConstraintSets in <var>newConstraints</var> in the order in
              which they were specified. For each ConstraintSet, if it and
              <var>successfulConstraints</var> together can be satisfied by
              <var>copy</var>, append it to the rear of
              <var>successfulConstraints</var>. Otherwise, skip it. </li>

              <li>In a single operation, remove <var>existingConstraints</var>
              from <var>object</var>, apply <var>successfulConstraints</var>,
              then apply the largest subset of <var>unorderedConstraints</var>
              that can be satisifed. (If more than one 'largest subset' can be
              satisfied, the UA is free to select which 'largest subset' it
              chooses.) Finally fire the <code>successCallback</code>. From
              this point on until applyConstraints() is called successfully
              again, getConstraints() <em class="rfc2119"
              title="must">must</em> return the <var>newConstraints</var> that
              were passed as an argument to this call. </li>

      <section id="registry">
        <h2>The Property Registry</h2>

        <p>There is a single <a href="#sec-iana">IANA registry</a> that
        defines the constrainable properties of all objects that implement the
        Constrainable pattern. The registry entries <em class="rfc2119"
        title="must">must</em> contain the name of each property along with
        its set of legal values. The registry entries for MediaStreamTrack are
        defined <a href="#sec-constraints">below</a>. The syntax for the
        specification of the set of legal values depends on the type of the
        values. In addition to the standard atomic types (boolean, long,
        double, DOMString), legal values include lists of any of the atomic
        types, plus min-max ranges, as defined below.</p>

        <p>List values <em class="rfc2119" title="must">must</em> be
        interpreted as disjunctions. For example, if a property 'facingMode'
        for a camera is defined as having legal values ["left", "right",
        "user", "environment"], this means that 'facingMode' can have the
        value "left", the value "right", the value "environment" or the value
        "user". Similarly <a>Constraints</a> restricting 'facingMode' to
        ["user", "left", "right"] would mean that the UA should select a
        camera (or point the camera, if that is possible) so that "facingMode"
        is either "user", "left", or "right". This Constraint would thus
        request that the camera not be facing away from the user, but would
        allow the UA to choose among the other directions.</p>

          </code>. The Capabilities dictionary specifies the subset of the
        constrainable properties and values from the registry that the UA
        supports. Note that a UA <em class="rfc2119" title="may">may</em>
        support only a subset of the properties that are defined in the

        Note that Capabilities are returned from the UA to the application,

        <p>Due to the limitiations of WebIDL, interfaces implementing the
        Constrainable Pattern cannnot simply subclass Constraints and
        ConstraintSet as they are defined here. Instead they must provide
        their own definitions that follow this pattern. See <a

        example of this.</p>

        <dl class="idl" title="typedef Dictionary ConstraintSet" />

        <p>Each member of a ConstraintSet corresponds to a Capability and
        specifies a subset of its legal values. Applying a ConstraintSet
        instructs that UA to restrict the setting of the corresponding
        Capabilities to the specified values or ranges of values. A given
        property MAY occur both in the basic Constraints set and in the
        advanced ConstraintSets list, and MAY occur at most once in each
        ConstraintSet in the advanced list.</p>

            can be satisfied individually, but not together, then whichever of
            C1 and C2 is first in this list will be satisfied, and the other

            optional constraint C3 is specified after C1 and C2, the UA will
            attempt to satisfy C3 even though C2 cannot be satisfied. Note
            that a given property name may occur only once in each
            ConstraintSet but may occur in more than one ConstraintSet.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>PermissionDeniedError: User denied permission for scripts from
        this origin to access the media device.</li>

        <li>ConstraintNotSatisfiedError: One of the mandatory constraints
        could not be satisfied.</li>

      <h1>Privacy and Security Considerations</h1>

      <p>This section is non-normative; it specifies no new behaviour, but
      instead summarizes information already present in other parts of the
      specification.</p>

      <p>This document extends the Web platform with the ability to manage
      input devices for media - in this iteration, microphones and cameras. It
      also allows the manipulation of audio output devices (speakers and
      headphones).</p>

      <p>Without authorization (to the “drive-by web”), it offers the ability
      to tell how many devices there are of each class. The identifiers for
      the devices are designed to not be useful for a fingerprint that can
      track the user between origins, but the number of devices adds to the
      fingerprint surface.</p>

      <p>When authorization is given, this document describes how to get
      access to, and use, media data from the devices mentioned. This data may
      be sensitive; advice is given that indicators should be supplied to
      indicate that devices are in use, but both the nature of authorization
      and the indicators of in-use devices are platform decisions.</p>

      <p>Authorization may be given on a case-by-case basis, or be persistent.
      In the case of a case-by-case authorization, it is important that the
      user be able to say “no” in a way that prevents the UI from blocking
      user interaction until permission is given - either by offering a way to
      say a “persistent NO” or by not using a modal permissions dialog.</p>

      <p>It is possible to use constraints so that the failure of a
      getUserMedia call will return information about devices on the system
      without prompting the user, which increases the surface available for
      fingerprinting. The UA should consider limiting the rate at which failed
      getUserMedia calls are allowed in order to limit this additional
      surface.</p>

      <p>In the case of persistent authorization, it is important that it’s
      easy to find the list of granted permissions and revoke permissions that
      the user wishes to revoke.</p>

      <p>Once permission has been granted, the UA should make two things
      readily apparent to the user: <ul>
          <li>That the page has access to the devices for which permission is
          given</li>

          <li>Whether or not any of the devices are presently recording ("on
          air") indicator</li>
        </ul> </p>
