=== NOTA BENE === ( http://bit.ly/VoL9Qt ) 
To generate the dated version of the specification:

* Open this document in Firefox.

* Press CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-S.

* Select "Save as HMTL (Source)" from dialog box.

* This will open a new tab with generated html. Copy and paste this to a new
file. Note if you use Chrome or Safari, this step will not work. What will
happen is the paste will have the original document, not what was displayed in
the window that you did the copy on. Save the file as the base name with
-YYYYMMDD appended like getusermedia-20111130.html or webrtc-20120128.html

* Create a new directory in archives correspoinding to the correct
day (YYYYMMDD)

* Copy the file and all associated resources (images/)  into the newly created
archive directory.

* Search for and edit the links for "This version" and "Previous version" and fix to point at the dated version of the spec 

* Add the new directory to git and make a commit.

* Create a new version tag:
  $ git tag -m "Editor's draft YYYYMMDD." vYYYYMMDD

* Push the commit and the new tag to the git repo:
  $ git push --tags origin master

* Once everyone is happy, the webrtc.html or getusermedia.html and the
corresponding archive folders can be copied to editor/ in the W3C CVS.

* Add the new archive directory (with content) to cvs:
  $ find archives/YYYYMMDD/ -type d | xargs cvs add
  $ find archives/YYYYMMDD/ -type f | grep -v CVS | xargs cvs add

* (Optional) See what will be committed:
  $ cvs -qn update

* Commit new directory and changed files (...):
  $ cvs commit -m "Added YYYYMMDD archived version." archives/YYYYMMDD/ ...

* Send an email to the corresponding lists to announce the new release (proposed
template below).
