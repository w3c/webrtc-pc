        This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to allow media
        and generic application data to be sent to and received from another
        browser or device implementing the appropriate set of real-time
        protocols. This specification is being developed in conjunction with a
        protocol specification developed by the IETF RTCWEB group and an API
        specification to get access to local media devices.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd" class="updateable-rec">
      <p>
        The API is based on preliminary work done in the WHATWG.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specification is feature complete and is expected to be stable with
        no further substantive change. Since the <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-webrtc-20191213/">previous Candidate
        Recommendation</a>, the following substantive changes have been brought
        to the specification:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the specification allows administrative prohibiting of ICE
        candidates to help prevent WebRTC to be used for portscanning
        </li>
        <li>the support for setting multiple DTLS certificates has been
        deprecated
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>voiceActivityFlag</code> has been marked at risk for lack of
          implementation
        </li>
        <li>the state machine when closing a <code>PeerConnection</code> has
        been clarified
        </li>
        <li>Align with latest changes in <a href=
        "https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-stats/">WebRTC Statistics</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Its <a href=
        "https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/webrtc">associated
        test suite</a> will be used to build an <a href=
        "https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-interop-reports/webrtc-pc-report.html">implementation
        report</a> of the API.
      </p>
      <p>
        To go into Proposed Recommendation status, the group expects to
        demonstrate implementation of each feature in at least two deployed
        browsers, and at least one implementation of each optional feature.
        Mandatory feature with only one implementation may be marked as
        optional in a revised Candidate Recommendation where applicable.

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are a number of facets to peer-to-peer communications and
        video-conferencing in HTML covered by this specification:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Connecting to remote peers using NAT-traversal technologies such as
        ICE, STUN, and TURN.
        </li>
        <li>Sending the locally-produced tracks to remote peers and receiving
        tracks from remote peers.
        </li>
        <li>Sending arbitrary data directly to remote peers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This document defines the APIs used for these features. This
        specification is being developed in conjunction with a protocol
        specification developed by the <a href=
        "https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rtcweb/">IETF RTCWEB group</a> and an
        API specification to get access to local media devices [[GETUSERMEDIA]]
        developed by the WebRTC Working Group. An overview of the system can be
        found in [[RFC8825]] and [[RFC8826]].

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that
        it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
        implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
        particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended
        to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
        this specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the
        ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]],
        as this specification uses that specification and terminology.

      <p class="note">
        The general principles for Javascript APIs apply, including the
        principle of <a href=
        "https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#js-rtc">run-to-completion</a>
        and no-data-races as defined in [[API-DESIGN-PRINCIPLES]]. That is,
        while a task is running, external events do not influence what's
        visible to the Javascript application. For example, the amount of data
        buffered on a data channel will increase due to "send" calls while
        Javascript is executing, and the decrease due to packets being sent
        will be visible after a task checkpoint.<br>
        It is the responsibility of the user agent to make sure the set of
        values presented to the application is consistent - for instance that
        getContributingSources() (which is synchronous) returns values for all
        sources measured at the same time.

          peer-to-peer communications with another {{RTCPeerConnection}}
          instance in another browser, or to another endpoint implementing the
          required protocols. Communications are coordinated by the exchange of
          control messages (called a signaling protocol) over a signaling
          channel which is provided by unspecified means, but generally by a
          script in the page via the server, e.g. using <a data-cite="?html/web-sockets.html#websocket">Web

                    multiple certificates that support different algorithms.
                    The final certificate will be selected based on the DTLS
                    handshake, which establishes which certificates are
                    allowed. The {{RTCPeerConnection}} implementation selects
                    which of the certificates is used for a given connection;
                    how certificates are selected is outside the scope of this

                    This option allows applications to establish key
                    continuity. An {{RTCCertificate}} can be persisted in

          The [[!RFC8829]] specification, as a whole, describes the details of how
          the {{RTCPeerConnection}} operates. References to specific

          <p>
            Calling <code>new
            {{RTCPeerConnection}}(<var>configuration</var>)</code> creates an
            {{RTCPeerConnection}} object.
          </p>
          <p>
            <var>configuration</var>.{{RTCConfiguration/iceServers}} contains
            information used to find and access the servers used by ICE. The
            application can supply multiple servers of each type, and any TURN
            server MAY also be used as a STUN server for the purposes of
            gathering server reflexive candidates.
          </p>
          <p>
            An {{RTCPeerConnection}} object has a <dfn>signaling state</dfn>, a
            <dfn>connection state</dfn>, an <dfn>ICE gathering state</dfn>, and
            an <dfn>ICE connection state</dfn>. These are initialized when the

            The ICE protocol implementation of an {{RTCPeerConnection}} is
            represented by an <dfn>ICE agent</dfn> [[RFC5245]]. Certain
            {{RTCPeerConnection}} methods involve interactions with the [= ICE
            Agent =], namely {{addIceCandidate}}, {{setConfiguration}},
            {{setLocalDescription}}, {{setRemoteDescription}} and {{close}}.
            These interactions are described in the relevant sections in this
            document and in [[!RFC8829]]. The [= ICE Agent =] also provides
            indications to the user agent when the state of its internal
            representation of an {{RTCIceTransport}} changes, as described in
            <a href="#rtcicetransport"></a>.

                    The {{createOffer}} method generates a blob of SDP that

                    configurations for the session, including descriptions of
                    the local {{MediaStreamTrack}}s attached to this
                    {{RTCPeerConnection}}, the codec/RTP/RTCP capabilities
                    supported by this implementation, and parameters of the [=

                    {{setLocalDescription}} will succeed when it attempts to

                    The process of generating an SDP exposes a subset of the
                    media capabilities of the underlying system, which provides
                    generally persistent cross-origin information on the
                    device. It thus increases the fingerprinting surface of the
                    application. In privacy-sensitive contexts, browsers can
                    consider mitigations such as generating SDP matching only a
                    common subset of the capabilities.

          Session Negotiation Model
        </h3>
        <p>
          Many changes to state of an {{RTCPeerConnection}} will require
          communication with the remote side via the signaling channel, in
          order to have the desired effect. The app can be kept informed as to
          when it needs to do signaling, by listening to the
          {{RTCPeerConnection/negotiationneeded}} event. This event is fired
          according
          to the state of the connection's <dfn>negotiation-needed flag</dfn>,
          represented by a {{RTCPeerConnection/[[NegotiationNeeded]]}} internal slot.

            Setting Negotiation-Needed

          <p>
            If an operation is performed on an {{RTCPeerConnection}} that
            requires signaling, the connection will be marked as needing
            negotiation. Examples of such operations include adding or stopping
            an {{RTCRtpTransceiver}}, or adding the first {{ RTCDataChannel}}.
          </p>
          <p>
            Internal changes within the implementation can also result in the
            connection being marked as needing negotiation.

            The {{RTCPeerConnection/icecandidate}} event is used for three different types of

                  An {{RTCIceTransport}} has finished gathering a [= generation

                  indication as defined by Section 8.2 of [[RFC8838]]. This
                  is indicated by
                  {{RTCPeerConnectionIceEvent/candidate}}.{{RTCIceCandidate/candidate}}
                  being set to an empty string. The

                  signaled to the remote peer and passed into
                  {{RTCPeerConnection/addIceCandidate}} like a typical ICE
                  candidate, in order to provide the end-of-candidates

                  transitioned to {{RTCIceGatheringState/"complete"}}. This is
                  indicated by the {{RTCPeerConnectionIceEvent/candidate}}
                  member of the event being set to <code>null</code>. This only
                  exists for backwards compatibility, and this event does not
                  need to be signaled to the remote peer. It's equivalent to an

          Certificate Management

        <p>
          The certificates that {{RTCPeerConnection}} instances use to
          authenticate with peers use the {{RTCCertificate}} interface. These
          objects can be explicitly generated by applications using the
          {{RTCPeerConnection/generateCertificate}} method and can be provided
          in the {{RTCConfiguration}} when constructing a new
          {{RTCPeerConnection}} instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The explicit certificate management functions provided here are
          optional. If an application does not provide the
          {{RTCConfiguration/certificates}} configuration option when
          constructing an {{RTCPeerConnection}} a new set of certificates MUST
          be generated by the <a>user agent</a>. That set MUST include an ECDSA
          certificate with a private key on the P-256 curve and a signature
          with a SHA-256 hash.

                  The {{generateCertificate}} function causes the <a>user

                  corresponding private key. A handle to information is
                  provided in the form of the {{RTCCertificate}} interface. The
                  returned {{RTCCertificate}} can be used to control the

                  The certificate produced by this process also contains a

                  for compatibility reasons. Only the public key and the
                  resulting certificate fingerprint are used by
                  {{RTCPeerConnection}}, but it is more likely that a
                  certificate will be accepted if the certificate is well
                  formed. The browser selects the algorithm used to sign the
                  certificate; a browser SHOULD select SHA-256 [[!FIPS-180-4]]

                  The resulting certificate MUST NOT include information that
                  can be linked to a user or <a>user agent</a>. Randomized
                  values for distinguished name and serial number SHOULD be

            For the purposes of this API, the {{RTCCertificate/[[Certificate]]}} slot
            contains unstructured binary data. No mechanism is provided for
            applications to access the {{RTCCertificate/[[KeyingMaterialHandle]]}}
            internal slot or the keying material it references. Implementations
            MUST support applications storing and retrieving {{RTCCertificate}}
            objects from persistent storage, in a manner that also preserves
            the keying material referenced by {{RTCCertificate/[[KeyingMaterialHandle]]}}.
            Implementations SHOULD store the sensitive keying material in a
            secure module safe from same-process memory attacks. This allows
            the private key to be stored and used, but not easily read using a
            memory attack.

        RTP Media API
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <dfn>RTP media API</dfn> lets a web application send and receive
        {{MediaStreamTrack}}s over a peer-to-peer connection. Tracks, when
        added to an {{RTCPeerConnection}}, result in signaling; when this
        signaling is forwarded to a remote peer, it causes corresponding tracks
        to be created on the remote side.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        There is not an exact 1:1 correspondence between tracks sent by one
        {{RTCPeerConnection}} and received by the other. For one, IDs of tracks
        sent have no mapping to the IDs of tracks received. Also,
        {{RTCRtpSender/replaceTrack}} changes the track sent by an
        {{RTCRtpSender}} without creating a new track on the receiver side; the
        corresponding {{RTCRtpReceiver}} will only have a single track,
        potentially representing multiple sources of media stitched together.
        Both {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver}} and
        {{RTCRtpSender/replaceTrack}} can be used to cause the same track to be
        sent multiple times, which will be observed on the receiver side as
        multiple receivers each with its own separate track. Thus it's more
        accurate to think of a 1:1 relationship between an {{RTCRtpSender}} on
        one side and an {{RTCRtpReceiver}}'s track on the other side, matching
        senders and receivers using the {{RTCRtpTransceiver}}'s
        {{RTCRtpTransceiver/mid}} if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        When sending media, the sender may need to rescale or resample the
        media to meet various requirements including the envelope negotiated by
        SDP.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the rules in <span data-jsep="imageattr">[[!RFC8829]]</span>,
        the video MAY be downscaled in order to fit the SDP constraints. The
        media MUST NOT be upscaled to create fake data that did not occur in
        the input source, the media MUST NOT be cropped except as needed to
        satisfy constraints on pixel counts, and the aspect ratio MUST NOT be
        changed.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The WebRTC Working Group is seeking implementation feedback on the need
        and timeline for a more complex handling of this situation. Some
        possible designs have been discussed in <a href=
        "https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/1283">GitHub issue 1283</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When video is rescaled, for example for certain combinations of width
        or height and {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/ scaleResolutionDownBy}}
        values, situations when the resulting width or height is not an integer
        may occur. In such situations the user agent MUST use <a href=
        "https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#eqn-floor">the integer part of the
        result</a>. What to transmit if the integer part of the scaled width or
        height is zero is implementation-specific.
      </p>
      <p>
        The actual encoding and transmission of {{MediaStreamTrack}}s is
        managed through objects called {{RTCRtpSender}}s. Similarly, the
        reception and decoding of {{MediaStreamTrack}}s is managed through
        objects called {{RTCRtpReceiver}}s. Each {{RTCRtpSender}} is associated
        with at most one track, and each track to be received is associated
        with exactly one {{RTCRtpReceiver}}.
      </p>
      <p>
        The encoding and transmission of each {{MediaStreamTrack}} SHOULD be
        made such that its characteristics (<code class="gum">width</code>,
        <code class="gum">height</code> and <code class="gum">frameRate</code>
        for video tracks; <code class=
        "gum">sampleSize</code>, <code class="gum">sampleRate</code> and
        <code class="gum">channelCount</code> for audio tracks) are to a
        reasonable degree retained by the track created on the remote side.
        There are situations when this does not apply, there may for example be
        resource constraints at either endpoint or in the network or there may
        be {{RTCRtpSender}} settings applied that instruct the implementation
        to act differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        An {{RTCPeerConnection}} object contains a <dfn id="transceivers-set"
        data-lt="set of transceivers">set of {{RTCRtpTransceiver}}s</dfn>,
        representing the paired senders and receivers with some shared state.
        <span data-tests="RTCPeerConnection-getTransceivers.html">This set is
        initialized to the empty set when the {{RTCPeerConnection}} object is
        created.</span> {{RTCRtpSender}}s and {{RTCRtpReceiver}}s are always
        created at the same time as an {{RTCRtpTransceiver}}, which they will
        remain attached to for their lifetime. {{RTCRtpTransceiver}}s are
        created implicitly when the application attaches a {{MediaStreamTrack}}
        to an {{RTCPeerConnection}} via the {{RTCPeerConnection/addTrack()}}
        method, or explicitly when the application uses the
        {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver}} method. They are also created when
        a remote description is applied that includes a new media description.
        Additionally, when a remote description is applied that indicates the
        remote endpoint has media to send, the relevant {{MediaStreamTrack}}
        and {{RTCRtpReceiver}} are surfaced to the application via the
        {{RTCPeerConnection/track}} event.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order for an {{RTCRtpTransceiver}} to send and/or receive media with
        another endpoint this must be negotiated with SDP such that both
        endpoints have an {{RTCRtpTransceiver}} object that is [= associated =]
        with the same [= media description =].
      </p>
      <p>
        When creating an offer, enough media descriptions will be generated to
        cover all transceivers on that end. When this offer is set as the local
        description, any disassociated transceivers get associated with media
        descriptions in the offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        When an offer is set as the remote description, any media descriptions
        in it not yet associated with a transceiver get associated with a new
        or existing transceiver. In this case, only disassociated transceivers
        that were created via the {{RTCPeerConnection/addTrack()}} method may
        be associated. Disassociated transceivers created via the
        {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver()}} method, however, won't get
        associated even if media descriptions are available in the remote
        offer. Instead, new transceivers will be created and associated if
        there aren't enough {{RTCPeerConnection/addTrack()}}-created
        transceivers. This sets {{RTCPeerConnection/addTrack()}}-created and
        {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver()}}-created transceivers apart in a
        critical way that is not observable from inspecting their attributes.
      </p>
      <p>
        When creating an answer, only media descriptions that were
        present in the offer may be listed in the answer. As a consequence, any
        transceivers that were not associated when setting the remote offer
        remain disassociated after setting the local answer. This can be
        remedied by the answerer creating a follow-up offer, initiating another
        offer/answer exchange, or in the case of using
        {{RTCPeerConnection/addTrack()}}-created transceivers, making sure that
        enough media descriptions are offered in the initial exchange.

          <p>
            An application can reject incoming media descriptions by setting
            the transceiver's direction to either
            {{RTCRtpTransceiverDirection/"inactive"}} to turn off both
            directions temporarily, or to
            {{RTCRtpTransceiverDirection/"sendonly"}} to reject only the
            incoming side. To permanently reject an m-line in a manner that
            makes it available for reuse, the application would need to call
            {{RTCRtpTransceiver}}.{{RTCRtpTransceiver/stop()}} and subsequently
            initiate negotiation from its end.

                  {{setParameters}} does not cause SDP renegotiation and can
                  only be used to change what the media stack is sending or
                  receiving within the envelope negotiated by Offer/Answer. The
                  attributes in the {{RTCRtpSendParameters}} dictionary are
                  designed to not enable this, so attributes like
                  {{RTCRtcpParameters/cname}} that cannot be changed are
                  read-only. Other things, like bitrate, are controlled using
                  limits such as {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/maxBitrate}}, where
                  the user agent needs to ensure it does not exceed the maximum
                  bitrate specified by {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/maxBitrate}},
                  while at the same time making sure it satisfies constraints
                  on bitrate specified in other places such as the SDP.

                    When present, indicates the maximum bitrate that can be
                    used to send this encoding. The user agent is free to
                    allocate bandwidth between the encodings, as long as the
                    {{maxBitrate}} value is not exceeded. The encoding may also
                    be further constrained by other limits (such as
                    per-transport or per-session bandwidth limits) below the
                    maximum specified here. {{maxBitrate}} is computed the same
                    way as the Transport Independent Application Specific
                    Maximum (TIAS) bandwidth defined in [[RFC3890]] Section
                    6.2.2, which is the maximum bandwidth needed without
                    counting IP or other transport layers like TCP or UDP. The
                    unit of {{maxBitrate}} is bits per second.

                  <p class="note">
                    How the bitrate is achieved is media and encoding
                    dependent. For video, a frame will always be sent as fast
                    as possible, but frames may be dropped until bitrate is low
                    enough. Thus, even a bitrate of zero will allow sending one
                    frame. For audio, it might be necessary to stop playing if
                    the bitrate does not allow the chosen encoding enough
                    bandwidth to be sent.

                    given value before sending. For example, if the value is
                    2.0, the video will be scaled down by a factor of 2 in each
                    dimension, resulting in sending a video of one quarter the
                    size. If the value is 1.0, the video will not be affected.
                    The value must be greater than or equal to 1.0. By default,
                    scaling is applied by a factor of two to the power of the

                    e.g. 4:2:1. If there is only one layer, the sender will by

          The <dfn>RTCRtpContributingSource</dfn> and
          <dfn>RTCRtpSynchronizationSource</dfn> dictionaries contain
          information about a given contributing source (CSRC) or
          synchronization source (SSRC) respectively. When an audio or video
          frame from one or more RTP packets is delivered to the
          {{RTCRtpReceiver}}'s {{MediaStreamTrack}}, the user agent MUST queue
          a task to update the relevant information for the
          {{RTCRtpContributingSource}} and {{RTCRtpSynchronizationSource}}
          dictionaries based on the content of those packets. The information
          relevant to the {{RTCRtpSynchronizationSource}} dictionary
          corresponding to the SSRC identifier, is updated each time, and if an
          RTP packet contains CSRC identifiers, then the information relevant
          to the {{RTCRtpContributingSource}} dictionaries corresponding to
          those CSRC identifiers is also updated. The user agent MUST process
          RTP packets in order of ascending RTP timestamps. The user agent MUST
          keep information from RTP packets delivered to the
          {{RTCRtpReceiver}}'s {{MediaStreamTrack}} in the previous 10 seconds.

                <p>
                  Both RFCs define the level as an integral value from 0 to 127
                  representing the audio level in negative decibels relative to
                  the loudest signal that the system could possibly encode.

            Simulcast functionality
          </h3>
          <p data-test="simulcast/basic.https.html">
            Simulcast functionality is provided via the
            {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver}} method of the
            {{RTCPeerConnection}} object and the {{RTCRtpSender/setParameters}}
            method of the {{RTCRtpSender}} object.
          </p>
          <p class="needs-test">
            The {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver}} method establishes the
            <dfn>simulcast envelope</dfn> which includes the maximum number of
            simulcast streams that can be sent, as well as the ordering of the
            {{RTCRtpSendParameters/encodings}}. While characteristics of
            individual simulcast streams can be modified using the
            {{RTCRtpSender/setParameters}} method, the [= simulcast envelope =]
            cannot be changed. One of the implications of this model is that
            the {{RTCPeerConnection/addTrack()}} method cannot provide
            simulcast functionality since it does not take
            {{RTCRtpTransceiverInit/sendEncodings}} as an argument, and
            therefore cannot configure an {{RTCRtpTransceiver}} to send
            simulcast.
          </p>
          <p class="needs-test">
            Another implication is that the answerer cannot set the [=
            simulcast envelope =] directly. Upon calling the
            {{RTCPeerConnection/setRemoteDescription}} method of the
            {{RTCPeerConnection}} object, the [= simulcast envelope =] is
            configured on the {{RTCRtpTransceiver}} to contain the layers
            described by the specified session description. Once the
            envelope is determined, layers cannot be removed. They can be
            marked as inactive by setting the
            {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/active}} member to <code>false</code>
            effectively disabling the layer.
          </p>
          <p data-tests="simulcast/getStats.https.html">
            While {{RTCRtpSender/setParameters}} cannot modify the [= simulcast
            envelope =], it is still possible to control the number of streams
            that are sent and the characteristics of those streams. Using
            {{RTCRtpSender/setParameters}}, simulcast streams can be made
            inactive by setting the {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/active}} member
            to <code>false</code>, or can be reactivated by setting the
            {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/active}} member to <code>true</code>.
            Using {{RTCRtpSender/setParameters}}, stream characteristics can be
            changed by modifying attributes such as
            {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/maxBitrate}}.

            Simulcast is frequently used to send multiple encodings to an SFU,
            which will then forward one of the simulcast streams to the end
            user. The user agent is therefore expected to allocate bandwidth
            between encodings in such a way that all simulcast streams are
            usable on their own; for instance, if two simulcast streams have
            the same {{RTCRtpEncodingParameters/maxBitrate}}, one would expect
            to see a similar bitrate on both streams. If bandwidth does not
            permit all simulcast streams to be sent in an usable form, the user
            agent is expected to stop sending some of the simulcast streams.

            As defined in <span data-jsep="simulcast">[[!RFC8829]]</span>, an
            offer from a user-agent will only contain a "send" description and
            no "recv" description on the <code class="sdp">a=simulcast</code>
            line. Alternatives and restrictions (described in
            [[RFC8853]]) are not supported.

            This specification does not define how to configure reception of
            multiple RTP encodings using {{RTCPeerConnection/createOffer}},
            {{RTCPeerConnection/createAnswer}} or
            {{RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver}}. However when
            {{RTCPeerConnection/setRemoteDescription}} is called with a
            corresponding remote description that is able to send multiple RTP
            encodings as defined in [[!RFC8829]], and the browser supports
            receiving multiple RTP encodings, the {{RTCRtpReceiver}} may
            receive multiple RTP encodings and the parameters retrieved via the
            transceiver's
            {{RTCRtpTransceiver/receiver}}.{{RTCRtpReceiver/getParameters()}}
            will reflect the encodings negotiated.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            An {{RTCRtpReceiver}} can receive multiple RTP streams in a
            scenario where a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) switches between
            simulcast streams it receives from user agents. If the SFU does not
            rewrite RTP headers so as to arrange the switched streams into a
            single RTP stream prior to forwarding, the {{RTCRtpReceiver}} will
            receive packets from distinct RTP streams, each with their own SSRC
            and sequence number space. While the SFU may only forward a single
            RTP stream at any given time, packets from multiple RTP streams can
            become intermingled at the receiver due to reordering. An
            {{RTCRtpReceiver}} equipped to receive multiple RTP streams will
            therefore need to be able to correctly order the received packets,
            recognize potential loss events and react to them. Correct
            operation in this scenario is non-trivial and therefore is optional
            for implementations of this specification.

        <p>
          The {{RTCDtlsTransport}} interface allows an application access to
          information about the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
          transport over which RTP and RTCP packets are sent and received by
          {{RTCRtpSender}} and {{RTCRtpReceiver}} objects, as well other data
          such as SCTP packets sent and received by data channels. In
          particular, DTLS adds security to an underlying transport, and the
          {{RTCDtlsTransport}} interface allows access to information about the
          underlying transport and the security added. {{RTCDtlsTransport}}
          objects are constructed as a result of calls to
          {{RTCPeerConnection/setLocalDescription()}} and
          {{RTCPeerConnection/setRemoteDescription()}}. Each
          {{RTCDtlsTransport}} object represents the DTLS transport layer for
          the RTP or RTCP {{RTCIceTransport/component}} of a specific
          {{RTCRtpTransceiver}}, or a group of {{RTCRtpTransceiver}}s if such a
          group has been negotiated via [[RFC8843]].
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          A new DTLS association for an existing {{RTCRtpTransceiver}} will be
          represented by an existing {{RTCDtlsTransport}} object, whose
          {{RTCDtlsTransport/state}} will be updated accordingly, as opposed to
          being represented by a new object.

          <dfn>RTCIceTransport</dfn> Interface
        </h3>
        <p>
          The {{RTCIceTransport}} interface allows an application access to
          information about the ICE transport over which packets are sent and
          received. In particular, ICE manages peer-to-peer connections which
          involve state which the application may want to access.
          {{RTCIceTransport}} objects are constructed as a result of calls to
          {{RTCPeerConnection/setLocalDescription()}} and
          {{RTCPeerConnection/setRemoteDescription()}}. The underlying ICE
          state is managed by the <a>ICE agent</a>; as such, the state of an
          {{RTCIceTransport}} changes when the [= ICE Agent =] provides
          indications to the user agent as described below. Each
          {{RTCIceTransport}} object represents the ICE transport layer for the
          RTP or RTCP {{RTCIceTransport/component}} of a specific
          {{RTCRtpTransceiver}}, or a group of {{RTCRtpTransceiver}}s if such a
          group has been negotiated via [[RFC8843]].
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          An ICE restart for an existing {{RTCRtpTransceiver}} will be
          represented by an existing {{RTCIceTransport}} object, whose
          {{RTCIceTransport/state}} will be updated accordingly, as opposed to
          being represented by a new object.

                    The [= ICE Agent =] has determined that connectivity is
                    currently lost for this {{RTCIceTransport}}. This is a
                    transient state that may trigger intermittently (and
                    resolve itself without action) on a flaky network. The way
                    this state is determined is implementation dependent.

                      <li>Losing the network interface for the connection in

                    This is a terminal state until ICE is restarted. Since an

            The most common transitions for a successful call will be new -&gt;
            checking -&gt; connected -&gt; completed, but under specific
            circumstances (only the last checked candidate succeeds, and
            gathering and the no-more candidates indication both occur prior to
            success), the state can transition directly from
            {{RTCIceTransportState/"checking"}} to
            {{RTCIceTransportState/"completed"}}.
          </p>
          <p>
            An ICE restart causes candidate gathering and connectivity checks to
            begin anew, causing a transition to
            {{RTCIceTransportState/"connected"}} if begun in the
            {{RTCIceTransportState/"completed"}} state. If begun in the
            transient {{RTCIceTransportState/"disconnected"}} state, it causes
            a transition to {{RTCIceTransportState/"checking"}}, effectively
            forgetting that connectivity was previously lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            The {{RTCIceTransportState/"failed"}} and
            {{RTCIceTransportState/"completed"}} states require an indication
            that there are no additional remote candidates. This can be
            indicated by calling {{RTCPeerConnection/addIceCandidate}} with a
            candidate value whose {{RTCIceCandidate/candidate}} property is set
            to an empty string or by
            {{RTCPeerConnection/canTrickleIceCandidates}} being set to
            <code>false</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some example state transitions are:

            <li>({{RTCIceTransportState/"checking"}}, found usable connection):

        <h3>
          <dfn>RTCDataChannel</dfn>
        </h3>
        <p data-tests="protocol/sctp-format.html">
          The {{RTCDataChannel}} interface represents a bi-directional data
          channel between two peers. An {{RTCDataChannel}} is created via a
          factory method on an {{RTCPeerConnection}} object. The messages sent
          between the browsers are described in [[RFC8831]] and
          [[RFC8832]].
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two ways to establish a connection with {{RTCDataChannel}}.
          The first way is to simply create an {{RTCDataChannel}} at one of the
          peers with the {{RTCDataChannelInit/negotiated}}
          {{RTCDataChannelInit}} dictionary member unset or set to its default
          value false. This will announce the new channel in-band and trigger
          an {{RTCDataChannelEvent}} with the corresponding {{RTCDataChannel}}
          object at the other peer. The second way is to let the application
          negotiate the {{RTCDataChannel}}. To do this, create an
          {{RTCDataChannel}} object with the {{RTCDataChannelInit/negotiated}}
          {{RTCDataChannelInit}} dictionary member set to true, and signal
          out-of-band (e.g. via a web server) to the other side that it SHOULD
          create a corresponding {{RTCDataChannel}} with the
          {{RTCDataChannelInit/negotiated}} {{RTCDataChannelInit}} dictionary
          member set to true and the same {{RTCDataChannel/id}}. This will
          connect the two separately created {{RTCDataChannel}} objects. The
          second way makes it possible to create channels with asymmetric
          properties and to create channels in a declarative way by specifying
          matching {{RTCDataChannelInit/id}}s.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each {{RTCDataChannel}} has an associated <dfn data-lt=
          "data transport">underlying data transport</dfn> that is used to
          transport actual data to the other peer. In the case of SCTP data
          channels utilizing an {{RTCSctpTransport}} (which represents the
          state of the SCTP association), the underlying data transport is the
          SCTP stream pair. The transport properties of the [= underlying data
          transport =], such as in order delivery settings and reliability
          mode, are configured by the peer as the channel is created. The
          properties of a channel cannot change after the channel has been
          created. The actual wire protocol between the peers is specified by
          the WebRTC DataChannel Protocol specification [[RFC8831]].
        </p>
        <p>
          An {{RTCDataChannel}} can be configured to operate in different
          reliability modes. A reliable channel ensures that the data is
          delivered at the other peer through retransmissions. An unreliable
          channel is configured to either limit the number of retransmissions (
          {{RTCDataChannelInit/maxRetransmits}} ) or set a time during which
          transmissions (including retransmissions) are allowed (
          {{RTCDataChannelInit/maxPacketLifeTime}} ). These properties can not
          be used simultaneously and an attempt to do so will result in an
          error. Not setting any of these properties results in a reliable
          channel.
        </p>
        <p>
          An {{RTCDataChannel}}, created with
          {{RTCPeerConnection/createDataChannel}} or dispatched via an
          {{RTCDataChannelEvent}}, MUST initially be in the
          {{RTCDataChannelState/"connecting"}} state. When the
          {{RTCDataChannel}} object's [= underlying data transport =] is ready,
          the user agent MUST [= announce the RTCDataChannel as open =].

                  The {{bufferedAmount}} attribute MUST, on getting, return the

                  {{RTCDataChannel/send()}}. Even though the data transmission

                  loop to prevent race conditions. The value does not include
                  framing overhead incurred by the protocol, or buffering done
                  by the operating system or network hardware. The value of the

                  {{RTCDataChannelState/"open"}}; however, the slot does not
                  reset to zero once the channel closes. When the [= underlying

                  MUST queue a task that reduces {{RTCDataChannel/[[BufferedAmount]]}}

                  The tones parameter is treated as a series of characters. The
                  characters 0 through 9, A through D, #, and * generate the
                  associated DTMF tones. The characters a to d MUST be
                  normalized to uppercase on entry and are equivalent to A to
                  D. As noted in [[RTCWEB-AUDIO]] Section 3, support for the
                  characters 0 through 9, A through D, #, and * are required.
                  The character ',' MUST be supported, and indicates a delay of
                  2 seconds before processing the next character in the tones
                  parameter. All other characters (and only those other
                  characters) MUST be considered <dfn id=

                  The duration parameter indicates the duration in ms to use
                  for each character passed in the tones parameters. The
                  duration cannot be more than 6000 ms or less than 40 ms. The
                  default duration is 100 ms for each tone.

                <p>
                  The <var>interToneGap</var> parameter indicates the gap
                  between tones in ms. The user agent clamps it to at least 30
                  ms and at most 6000 ms. The default value is 70 ms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The browser MAY increase the <var>duration</var> and
                  <var>interToneGap</var> times to cause the times that DTMF
                  start and stop to align with the boundaries of RTP packets
                  but it MUST not increase either of them by more than the
                  duration of a single RTP audio packet.

        <p class="no-test-needed">
          The basic statistics model is that the browser maintains a set of
          statistics for [= monitored object =]s, in the form of [= stats
          object =]s.
        </p><!-- Non-normative description of normative steps. -->
        <p class="no-test-needed">
          A group of related objects may be referenced by a <dfn id=
          "stats-selector">selector</dfn>. The selector may, for example, be a
          {{MediaStreamTrack}}. For a track to be a valid selector, it MUST be
          a {{MediaStreamTrack}} that is sent or received by the
          {{RTCPeerConnection}} object on which the stats request was issued.
          The calling Web application provides the selector to the
          {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}} method and the browser emits (in the
          JavaScript) a set of statistics that are relevant to the selector,
          according to the [= stats selection algorithm =]. Note that that
          algorithm takes the sender or receiver of a selector.
        </p>
        <!-- Lifetime of stats objects need to be tested on a per-type basis. -->
        <p class="no-test-needed">
          The statistics returned in [= stats object =]s are designed in such a
          way that repeated queries can be linked by the {{RTCStats}}
          {{RTCStats/id}} dictionary member. Thus, a Web application can make
          measurements over a given time period by requesting measurements at
          the beginning and end of that period.
        </p>
        <p class="no-test-needed">
          With a few exceptions, [= monitored object =]s, once created, exist
          for the duration of their associated {{RTCPeerConnection}}. This
          ensures statistics from them are available in the result from
          {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}} even past the associated peer
          connection being {{RTCPeerConnection/close}}d.
        </p>
        <!-- Lifetime of stats objects need to be tested on a per-type basis. -->
        <p class="no-test-needed">
          Only a few monitored objects have <a data-cite=
          "!WEBRTC-STATS#lifetime-considerations-for-monitored-objects">shorter
          lifetimes</a>. Statistics from these objects are no longer available
          in subsequent getStats() results. The object descriptions in
          [[!WEBRTC-STATS]] describe when these monitored objects are deleted.

          The {{RTCPeerConnection/getStats()}} method delivers a successful

          An {{RTCStats}} dictionary represents the [= stats object =]
          constructed by inspecting a specific [= monitored object =]. The
          {{RTCStats}} dictionary is a base type that specifies as set of

          Note that while stats names are standardized, any given

          size" can be computed as "bytes / packets" - if the intervals are
          different, this will yield errors. Thus implementations MUST return

        Media Stream API Extensions for Network Use

        <h3>
          Introduction
        </h3>
        <p class="no-test-needed">
          The {{MediaStreamTrack}} interface, as defined in the
          [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] specification, typically represents a stream of
          data of audio or video. One or more {{MediaStreamTrack}}s can be
          collected in a {{MediaStream}} (strictly speaking, a {{MediaStream}}
          as defined in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] may contain zero or more
          {{MediaStreamTrack}} objects).
        </p>
        <p>
          A {{MediaStreamTrack}} may be extended to represent a media flow that
          either comes from or is sent to a remote peer (and not just the local
          camera, for instance). The extensions required to enable this
          capability on the {{MediaStreamTrack}} object will be described in
          this section. How the media is transmitted to the peer is described
          in [[RFC8834]], [[RFC7874]], and [[RFC8835]].
        </p>
        <p class="no-test-needed">
          A {{MediaStreamTrack}} sent to another peer will appear as one and
          only one {{MediaStreamTrack}} to the recipient. A peer is defined as
          a user agent that supports this specification. In addition, the
          sending side application can indicate what {{MediaStream}} object(s)
          the {{MediaStreamTrack}} is a member of. The corresponding
          {{MediaStream}} object(s) on the receiver side will be created (if
          not already present) and populated accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          As also described earlier in this document, the objects
          {{RTCRtpSender}} and {{RTCRtpReceiver}} can be used by the
          application to get more fine grained control over the transmission
          and reception of {{MediaStreamTrack}}s.
        </p>
        <p class="untestable">
          Channels are the smallest unit considered in the Media Capture and
          Streams specification. Channels are intended to be encoded together
          for transmission as, for instance, an RTP payload type. All of the
          channels that a codec needs to encode jointly MUST be in the same
          {{MediaStreamTrack}} and the codecs SHOULD be able to encode, or
          discard, all the channels in the track.
        </p>
        <p class="no-test-needed">
          The concepts of an input and output to a given {{MediaStreamTrack}}
          apply in the case of {{MediaStreamTrack}} objects transmitted over
          the network as well. A {{MediaStreamTrack}} created by an
          {{RTCPeerConnection}} object (as described previously in this
          document) will take as input the data received from a remote peer.
          Similarly, a {{MediaStreamTrack}} from a local source, for instance a
          camera via [[!GETUSERMEDIA]], will have an output that represents
          what is transmitted to a remote peer if the object is used with an
          {{RTCPeerConnection}} object.
        </p>
        <p class="no-test-needed">
          The concept of duplicating {{MediaStream}} and {{MediaStreamTrack}}
          objects as described in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] is also applicable here.
          This feature can be used, for instance, in a video-conferencing
          scenario to display the local video from the user's camera and
          microphone in a local monitor, while only transmitting the audio to
          the remote peer (e.g. in response to the user using a "video mute"
          feature). Combining different {{MediaStreamTrack}} objects into new
          {{MediaStream}} objects is useful in certain situations.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          In this document, we only specify aspects of the following objects
          that are relevant when used along with an {{RTCPeerConnection}}.
          Please refer to the original definitions of the objects in the
          [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] document for general information on using
          {{MediaStream}} and {{MediaStreamTrack}}.

            The {{MediaStream/id}} attribute specified in {{MediaStream}}
            returns an id that is unique to this stream, so that streams can be
            recognized at the remote end of the {{RTCPeerConnection}} API.
          </p>
          <p class="needs-test">
            When a {{MediaStream}} is created to represent a stream obtained
            from a remote peer, the {{MediaStream/id}} attribute is initialized
            from information provided by the remote source.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            The {{MediaStream/id}} of a {{MediaStream}} object is unique to the
            source of the stream, but that does not mean it is not possible to
            end up with duplicates. For example, the tracks of a locally
            generated stream could be sent from one user agent to a remote peer
            using {{RTCPeerConnection}} and then sent back to the original user
            agent in the same manner, in which case the original user agent
            will have multiple streams with the same id (the locally-generated
            one and the one received from the remote peer).

        <h3>
          Perfect Negotiation Example
        </h3>
        <p>
          Perfect negotiation is a recommended pattern to manage negotiation
          transparently, abstracting this asymmetric task away from the rest of
          an application. This pattern has advantages over one side always
          being the offerer, as it lets applications operate on both peer
          connection objects simultaneously without risk of glare (an offer
          coming in outside of {{RTCSignalingState/"stable"}} state). The rest
          of the application may use any and all modification methods and
          attributes, without worrying about signaling state races.
        </p>
        <p>
          It designates different roles to the two peers, with behavior to
          resolve signaling collisions between them:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The <dfn>polite peer</dfn> uses rollback to avoid collision with
              an incoming offer.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The <dfn>impolite peer</dfn> ignores an incoming offer when this
              would collide with its own.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Together, they manage signaling for the rest of the application in a
          manner that doesn't deadlock. The example assumes a
          <code>polite</code> boolean variable indicating the designated role:
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">
const signaling = new SignalingChannel(); // handles JSON.stringify/parse

// call start() anytime on either end to add camera and microphone to connection

          Note that this is timing sensitive, and deliberately uses versions of
          {{RTCPeerConnection/setLocalDescription}} (without arguments) and
          {{RTCPeerConnection/setRemoteDescription}} (with implicit rollback)
          to avoid races with other signaling messages being serviced.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <var>ignoreOffer</var> variable is needed, because the
          {{RTCPeerConnection}} object on the impolite side is never told about
          ignored offers. We must therefore suppress errors from incoming
          candidates belonging to such offers.

        Privacy and Security Considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        This section is non-normative; it specifies no new behaviour, but
        instead summarizes information already present in other parts of the
        specification. The overall security considerations of the general set
        of APIs and protocols used in WebRTC are described in
        [[?RFC8827]].
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Impact on same origin policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This document extends the Web platform with the ability to set up
          real-time, direct communication between browsers and other devices,
          including other browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that data and media can be shared between applications
          running in different browsers, or between an application running in
          the same browser and something that is not a browser, something that
          is an extension to the usual barriers in the Web model against
          sending data between entities with different origins.
        </p>
        <p>
          The WebRTC specification provides no user prompts or chrome
          indicators for communication; it assumes that once the Web page has
          been allowed to access media, it is free to share that media with
          other entities as it chooses. Peer-to-peer exchanges of data view
          WebRTC datachannels can thus occur without any user explicit consent
          or involvement, similarly as a server-mediated exchange (e.g. via Web
          Sockets) could occur without user involvement.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>
          Revealing IP addresses
        </h2>
        <p>
          Even without WebRTC, the Web server providing a Web application will
          know the public IP address to which the application is delivered.
          Setting up communications exposes additional information about the
          browser’s network context to the web application, and may include the
          set of (possibly private) IP addresses available to the browser for
          WebRTC use. Some of this information has to be passed to the
          corresponding party to enable the establishment of a communication
          session.
        </p>
        <p>
          Revealing IP addresses can leak location and means of connection;
          this can be sensitive. Depending on the network environment, it can
          also increase the fingerprinting surface and create persistent
          cross-origin state that cannot easily be cleared by the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          A connection will always reveal the IP addresses proposed for
          communication to the corresponding party. The application can limit
          this exposure by choosing not to use certain addresses using the
          settings exposed by the {{RTCIceTransportPolicy}} dictionary, and by
          using relays (for instance TURN servers) rather than direct
          connections between participants. One will normally assume that the
          IP address of TURN servers is not sensitive information. These
          choices can for instance be made by the application based on whether
          the user has indicated consent to start a media connection with the
          other party.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mitigating the exposure of IP addresses to the application itself
          requires limiting the IP addresses that can be used, which will
          impact the ability to communicate on the most direct path between
          endpoints. Browsers are encouraged to provide appropriate controls
          for deciding which IP addresses are made available to applications,
          based on the security posture desired by the user. The choice of
          which addresses to expose is controlled by local policy (see
          [[RFC8828]] for details).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Impact on local network
        </h2>
        <p>
          Since the browser is an active platform executing in a trusted
          network environment (inside the firewall), it is important to limit
          the damage that the browser can do to other elements on the local
          network, and it is important to protect data from interception,
          manipulation and modification by untrusted participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mitigations include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A user agent will always request permission from the
          correspondent user agent to communicate using ICE. This ensures that
          the user agent can only send to partners who you have shared
          credentials with.
          </li>
          <li>A user agent will always request ongoing permission to continue
          sending using ICE continued consent. This enables a receiver to
          withdraw consent to receive.
          </li>
          <li>A user agent will always encrypt data, with strong per-session
          keying (DTLS-SRTP).
          </li>
          <li>A user agent will always use congestion control. This ensures
          that WebRTC cannot be used to flood the network.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These measures are specified in the relevant IETF documents.

      <section>
        <h2>
          Confidentiality of Communications
        </h2>
        <p>
          The fact that communication is taking place cannot be hidden from
          adversaries that can observe the network, so this has to be regarded
          as public information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Communication certificates may be opaquely shared using
          {{MessagePort/postMessage(message, options)}} in anticipation of future needs. User
          agents are strongly encouraged to isolate the private keying material
          these objects hold a handle to, from the processes that have access
          to the {{RTCCertificate}} objects, to reduce memory attack surface.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>
          Persistent information exposed by WebRTC
        </h2>
        <p>
          As described above, the list of IP addresses exposed by the WebRTC
          API can be used as a persistent cross-origin state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond IP addresses, the WebRTC API exposes information about the
          underlying media system via the
          {{RTCRtpSender}}.{{RTCRtpSender/getCapabilities}} and
          {{RTCRtpReceiver}}.{{RTCRtpReceiver/getCapabilities}} methods,
          including detailed and ordered information about the codecs that the
          system is able to produce and consume. A subset of that information
          is likely to be represented in the SDP session descriptions
          generated, exposed and transmitted during <a href=
          "#session-negotiation-model">session negotiation</a>. That
          information is in most cases persistent across time and origins, and
          increases the fingerprint surface of a given device.
        </p>
        <p>
          When establishing DTLS connections, the WebRTC API can generate
          certificates that can be persisted by the application (e.g. in
          IndexedDB). These certificates are not shared across origins, and get
          cleared when persistent storage is cleared for the origin.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Setting SDP from remote endpoints
        </h2>
        <p>
          {{RTCPeerConnection/setRemoteDescription}} guards against malformed
          and invalid SDP by throwing exceptions, but makes no attempt to guard
          against SDP that might be unexpected by the application. Setting the
          remote description can cause significant resources to be allocated
          (including image buffers and network ports), media to start flowing
          (which may have privacy and bandwidth implications) among other
          things. An application that does not guard against malicious SDP
          could be at risk of resource deprivation, unintentionally allowing
          incoming media or at risk of not having certain events fire like
          {{RTCPeerConnection/ontrack}} if the other endpoint does not
          negotiate sending. Applications need to be on guard against
          malevolent SDP.

        Accessibility Considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        The WebRTC 1.0 specification exposes an API to control protocols
        (defined within the IETF) necessary to establish real-time audio, video
        and data exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD/TTY) enables
        individuals who are hearing or speech impaired (among others) to
        communicate over telephone lines. Real-Time Text, defined in
        [[RFC4103]], utilizes T.140 encapsulated in RTP to enable the
        transition from TDD/TTY devices to IP-based communications, including
        emergency communication with <a href=
        "https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ada7cebd65433a9e05c35426a2bc76b8&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt47.3.67&amp;rgn=div5">
        Public Safety Access Points (PSAP)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Real-Time Text requires the ability to send and receive data in
        near real time, it can be best supported via the WebRTC 1.0 data
        channel API. As defined by the IETF, the data channel protocol utilizes
        the SCTP/DTLS/UDP protocol stack, which supports both reliable and
        unreliable data channels. The IETF chose to standardize SCTP/DTLS/UDP
        over proposals for an RTP data channel which relied on SRTP key
        management and were focused on unreliable communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the IETF chose a different approach than the RTP data channel as
        part of the WebRTC suite of protocols, as of the time of this
        publication there is no standardized way for the WebRTC APIs to
        directly support Real-Time Text as defined at IETF and implemented in
        U.S. (FCC) regulations. The WebRTC working Group will evaluate whether
        the developing IETF protocols in this space warrant direct exposure in
        the browser APIs and is looking for input from the relevant user
        communities on this potential gap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mmusic/">IETF MMUSIC
        Working Group</a>, work is ongoing to enable <a href=
        "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-holmberg-mmusic-t140-usage-data-channel">
        Real-time text to be sent over the WebRTC data channel</a>, allowing
        gateways to be deployed to translate between the SCTP data channel
        protocol and RFC 4103 Real-Time Text. This work, once completed, is
        expected to enable a unified and interoperable approach for integrating
        real-time text in WebRTC user-agents (including browsers) - through a
        gateway or otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time of this publication, gateways that enable effective RTT
        support in WebRTC clients can be developed e.g. through a custom WebRTC
        data channel. This is deemed sufficient until such time as future
        standardized gateways are enabled via IETF protocols such as the SCTP
        data channel protocol and RFC 4103 Real-Time Text. This will need to be
        defined at IETF in conjunction with related work at W3C groups to
        effectively and consistently standardise RTT support internationally.
