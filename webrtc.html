    <p>This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to allow media
    to be sent to and received from another browser or device implementing the
    appropriate set of real-time protocols. This specification is being
    developed in conjunction with a protocol specification developed by the
    IETF RTCWEB group and an API specification to get access to local media
    devices developed by the Media Capture Task Force.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="sotd">
    <p>This document is neither complete nor stable, and as such is not yet
    suitable for commercial implementation. However, early experimentation is
    encouraged. The API is based on preliminary work done in the WHATWG. The
    Web Real-Time Communications Working Group expects this specification to
    evolve significantly based on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The outcome of ongoing exchanges in the companion RTCWEB group at
      IETF to define the set of protocols that, together with this document,
      will enable real-time communications in Web browsers.</li>

      <li>Privacy issues that arise when exposing local capabilities and local
      streams.</li>

      <li>Technical discussions within the group.</li>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>There are a number of facets to video-conferencing in HTML covered by
    this specification:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Connecting to remote peers using NAT-traversal technologies such as
      ICE, STUN, and TURN.</li>

      <li>Sending the locally-produced streams to remote peers and receiving
      streams from remote peers.</li>

      <li>Sending arbitrary data directly to remote peers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This document defines the APIs used for these features. This
    specification is being developed in conjunction with a protocol
    specification developed by the <a href=
    "http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rtcweb/">IETF RTCWEB group</a> and an API
    specification to get access to local media devices
    [[!GETUSERMEDIA]]developed by the <a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc/">Media Capture Task Force</a>. An
    overview of the system can be found in [[RTCWEB-OVERVIEW]] and
    [[RTCWEB-SECURITY]].</p>
  </section>

  <section id="conformance">
    <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
    product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it
    contains.</p>

    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
    implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
    particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
    easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>

    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
    this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
    ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]], as
    this specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    <p>The <code><a href=
    "http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/webappapis.html#eventhandler">EventHandler</a></code>
    interface represents a callback used for event handlers as defined in

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>An <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> allows two users to
      communicate directly, browser to browser. Communications are coordinated
      via a signaling channel which is provided by unspecified means, but
      generally by a script in the page via the server, e.g. using
      <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> [[XMLHttpRequest]].</p>

        Defined in [[!RTCWEB-JSEP]].  The following is a non-normative
        summary for convenience.

        The BundlePolicy effects which media tracks are negotiated if
        the remote endpoint is not BUNDLE-aware, and what ICE
        candidates are gathered.  If the remote endpoint is
        BUNDLE-aware, all media tracks and data channels are BUNDLEd
        onto the same transport.

          <dt>balanced</dt>

          <dd>Gather ICE candidates for each media type in use (audio,
          video, and data).  If the remote endpoint is not
          BUNDLE-aware, negotiate only one audio and video track on
          separate transports.</dd>

          <dt>max-compat</dt>

          <dd>Gather ICE candidates for each track. If the remote

        <h4>Offer/Answer Options</h4>

            the remote side whether it wishes to receive video or not. This

            emergency calling or sounds other than spoken voice, it is
            desirable to be able to turn off this behavior. This option allows

      <h3>RTCPeerConnection Interface</h3>

      <p>The general operation of the RTCPeerConnection is described in
      [[!RTCWEB-JSEP]].</p>

      <section>
        <h4>Operation</h4>

        <p>Calling <code>new <a>RTCPeerConnection</a>(<var>configuration</var>
        )</code> creates an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>

        <p>The <var>configuration</var> has the information to find and access
        the servers used by ICE. There may be multiple servers of each type and
        any TURN server also acts as a STUN server.</p>

        <p>An <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object has an associated
        <dfn id="rtcpeerconnection-ice-agent">ICE agent</dfn> [[!ICE]],
        RTCPeerConnection signaling state, ICE gathering state, and ICE
        connection state. These are initialized when the object is created.</p>

        <p>When the <dfn id=
        "dom-peerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection()</code></dfn> constructor
        is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Validate the <code><a>RTCConfiguration</a></code> argument by
            running the steps defined by the <a href=
            "#dom-peerconnection-setconfiguration">setConfiguration()</a> method.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let <var>connection</var> be a newly created
            <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Create an ICE Agent as defined in [[!ICE]] and let
            <var>connection</var>'s <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> ICE Agent be
            that ICE Agent and provide it the the <a href=
            "#ice-servers-list">ICE servers list</a>. The ICE Agent will
            proceed with gathering as soon as the <a href=
            "#ice-transports-setting">ICE transports setting</a> is not set to
            <code>none</code>. At this point the ICE Agent does not know how
            many ICE components it needs (and hence the number of candidates to
            gather), but it can make a reasonable assumption such as 2. As the
            <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> object gets more information, the
            ICE Agent can adjust the number of components.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Set <var>connection</var>'s <a href=
            "#dom-peerconnection-signaling-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
            signalingState</a> to <code>stable</code>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Set <var>connection</var>'s <a href=
            "#dom-peerconnection-ice-connection-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
            ice connection state</a> to <code>new</code>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Set <var>connection</var>'s <a href=
            "#dom-peerconnection-ice-gathering-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
            ice gathering state</a> to <code>new</code>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Initialize an internal variable to represent a queue of
            <code>operations</code> with an empty set.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Return <var>connection</var>.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Once the RTCPeerConnection object has been initialized, for every
        call to <code>createOffer</code>, <code>setLocalDescription</code>,
        <code>createAnswer</code> and <code>setRemoteDescription</code>;
        execute the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Append an object representing the current call being handled
            (i.e. function name and corresponding arguments) to the
            <code>operations</code> array.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the length of the <code>operations</code> array is exactly 1,
            execute the function from the front of the queue
            asynchronously.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>When the asynchronous operation completes (either successfully
            or with an error), remove the corresponding object from the
            <code>operations</code> array. After removal, if the array is
            non-empty, execute the first object queued asynchronously and
            repeat this step on completion.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The general idea is to have only one among <code>createOffer</code>,
        <code>setLocalDescription</code>, <code>createAnswer</code> and
        <code>setRemoteDescription</code> executing at any given time. If
        subsequent calls are made while one of them is still executing, they
        are added to a queue and processed when the previous operation is fully
        completed. It is valid, and expected, for normal error handling
        procedures to be applied.</p>

        <p>Additionally, during the lifetime of the RTCPeerConnection object,
        the following procedures are followed when an ICE event occurs:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>If the <a href=
            "#dom-peerconnection-ice-gathering-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
            ice gathering state</a> is <code>new</code> and the <a href=
            "#ice-transports-setting">ICE transports setting</a> is not set to
            <code>none</code>, the user agent MUST queue a task to start
            gathering ICE addresses and set the <a href=
            "#dom-peerconnection-ice-gathering-state">ice gathering state</a>
            to <code>gathering</code>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the ICE Agent has found one or more candidate pairs for each
            <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> that forms a valid connection, the ICE connection
            state is changed to "connected".</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>When the ICE Agent finishes checking all candidate pairs, if at
            least one connection has been found for each <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>, the
            <a href=
            "#dom-peerconnection-ice-connection-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
            ice connection state</a> is changed to "completed"; otherwise
            "failed".</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

          <p>The section above shouldn't need to reference MediaStreamTracks when

              to discover the types of capabilities of the browser including
              which codecs may be supported. The SDP should have any ports set
              to 0 (Open Issue: should this be 9?). Other values that would

            optional RTCOfferOptions options)</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>The createOffer method generates a blob of SDP that contains an
            RFC 3264 offer with the supported configurations for the session,
            including descriptions of the local <code>MediaStream</code>s
            attached to this <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, the codec/RTP/RTCP
            options supported by this implementation, and any candidates that
            have been gathered by the ICE Agent. The options parameter may be
            supplied to provide additional control over the offer
            generated.</p>

            <p>As an offer, the generated SDP will contain the full set of
            capabilities supported by the session (as opposed to an answer,
            which will include only a specific negotiated subset to use); for
            each SDP line, the generation of the SDP must follow the
            appropriate process for generating an offer. In the event
            createOffer is called after the session is established, createOffer
            will generate an offer that is compatible with the current session,
            incorporating any changes that have been made to the session since
            the last complete offer-answer exchange, such as addition or
            removal of streams. If no changes have been made, the offer will
            include the capabilities of the current local description as well
            as any additional capabilities that could be negotiated in an
            updated offer.</p>

            <p>Session descriptions generated by createOffer MUST be
            immediately usable by setLocalDescription without causing an error
            as long as setLocalDescription is called reasonably soon.
            If a system has limited resources (e.g. a finite number
            of decoders), createOffer needs to return an offer that reflects
            the current state of the system, so that setLocalDescription will
            succeed when it attempts to acquire those resources. The session
            descriptions MUST remain usable by setLocalDescription without
            causing an error until at least the end of the fulfillment callback of the
            returned promise. Calling this method is needed to get the ICE user name
            fragment and password.</p>

            <p>If the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> is configured to generate
            Identity assertions, then the session description SHALL contain an
            appropriate assertion.</p>

            <p>If this <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> object is closed before
            the SDP generation process completes, the USER agent MUST suppress
            the result and not resolve or reject the returned promise.</p>

            <p>If the SDP generation process completed successfully, the user
            agent MUST resolve the returned promise with a
            newly created <code><a>RTCSessionDescription</a></code> object,
            representing the generated offer.</p>

            <p>If the SDP generation process failed for any reason, the user
            agent MUST reject the returned promise with
            an <code>DOMError</code> object of type TBD as its argument.</p>

            <p>To Do: Discuss privacy aspects of this from a fingerprinting
            point of view - it's probably around as bad as access to a canvas
            :-)</p>

          <dt>Promise&lt;RTCSessionDescription&gt; createAnswer ()</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>The createAnswer method generates an [[!SDP]] answer with the
            supported configuration for the session that is compatible with the
            parameters in the remote configuration. Like createOffer, the
            returned blob contains descriptions of the local MediaStreams
            attached to this RTCPeerConnection, the codec/RTP/RTCP options
            negotiated for this session, and any candidates that have been
            gathered by the ICE Agent. The options parameter may be supplied to
            provide additional control over the generated answer.</p>

            <p>As an answer, the generated SDP will contain a specific
            configuration that, along with the corresponding offer, specifies
            how the media plane should be established. The generation of the
            SDP must follow the appropriate process for generating an
            answer.</p>

            <p>Session descriptions generated by createAnswer must be
            immediately usable by setLocalDescription without causing an
            error as long as setLocalDescription is called reasonably soon.
            Like createOffer, the returned description should reflect
            the current state of the system. The session descriptions MUST
            remain usable by setLocalDescription without causing an error until
            at least the end of the fulfillment callback of the returned promise. Calling this
            method is needed to get the ICE user name fragment and
            password.</p>

            <p>An answer can be marked as provisional, as described in
            [[!RTCWEB-JSEP]], by setting the <code><a href=
            "#widl-RTCSessionDescription-type">type</a></code> to
            <code>"pranswer"</code>.</p>

            <p>If the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> is configured to generate
            Identity assertions, then the session description SHALL contain an
            appropriate assertion.</p>

            <p>If this <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> object is closed before
            the SDP generation process completes, the USER agent MUST suppress
            the result and not resolve or reject the returned promise.</p>

            <p>If the SDP generation process completed successfully, the user
            agent MUST resolve the returned promise with a
            newly created <code><a>RTCSessionDescription</a></code> object,
            representing the generated answer.</p>

            <p>If the SDP generation process failed for any reason, the user
            agent MUST reject the returned promise with a <code>DOMError</code>
            object of type TBD.</p>

            <p>This API changes the local media state. In order to successfully

            simultaneously support use of both the old and new local
            descriptions (e.g. support codecs that exist in both descriptions)
            until a final answer is received, at which point the
            <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> can fully adopt the new local

                Alternatively, if the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> has

                <p>If there is a <a href="#target-peer-identity">target peer

      <section>
        <h4>General Principles</h4>

        <p>All methods that return promises are governed by the standard error
        handling rules of promises. Methods that do not return promises may throw
        exceptions to indicate errors.</p>

        <p>Legacy-methods may only throw exceptions to indicate invalid state
        and other programming errors. For example, when a legacy-method is
        called when the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> is in an invalid
        state or a state in which that particular method is not allowed to be
        executed, it will throw an exception. In all other cases, legacy methods
        MUST provide an error object to the error callback.</p>

      <h3>Session Negotiation Model</h3>
      <p>Many changes to state of an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> will
        require communication with
        the remote side via the signaling channel, in order to have the desired
        effect. The app can be kept informed as to when it needs to do signaling,
        by listening to the negotiationneeded event.</p>
      <section>
        <h4>Setting Negotiation-Needed</h4>
        <p>If an operation is performed on an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>
          that requires signaling,
          the connection will be marked as needing negotiation. Examples of such
          operations include adding or stopping a track, or adding the first
          data channel.</p>
        <p>Internal changes within the implementation can also result in the
          connection being marked as needing negotiation. For example, if a
          <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> enters the ended state because
          its source device became unavailable.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Clearing Negotiation-Needed</h4>
        <p>The negotiation-needed state is cleared when
          <code>setLocalDescription</code> is
          called (either for an offer or answer), and the supplied description
          matches the state of the tracks/datachannels that currenly exist on the
          <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>. Specifically, this means that
          all live tracks have an associated section in the local description
          with their MSID, all ended tracks have been removed from the local
          description, and, if any data channels have been created, a data
          section exists in the local description.</p>
        <p>Note that <code>setLocalDescription(answer)</code> will clear the
          negotiation-needed state only if the offer had a corresponding section for
          all the tracks/datachannels on the answerer side. Otherwise, a new offer by
          the answerer is still needed, and so the state is not cleared.</p>

        <h4>Firing An Event</h4>
        <p>When the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> <var>connection</var>
           is marked as negotiation-needed, and it was not already marked as such:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the signaling state is stable, schedule a task to check the
            negotiation-needed state and, if still set, fire an
            <a href="#event-negotiation">negotiationneeded</a> event on
            <var>connection</var>.</li>
          <li>Otherwise, do nothing. If necessary, an event will be fired during
            <code>setLocalDescription</code> or

      <h2>RTP Media API</h2>

      <p>The RTP media API lets a web application send and receive <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s
      over a peer-to-peer connection. Tracks, when added to a RTCPeerConnection, result in
      signaling; when this signaling is forwarded to a remote peer, it causes
      corresponding tracks to be created on the remote side.</p>

      <p>The actual encoding and transmission of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s is managed through
      objects called <code>RTCRtpSender</code>s. Similarly, the reception and decoding of
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s is managed through objects called <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code>s.
      Each track to be sent is associated with exactly one <code>RTCRtpSender</code>, and
      each track to be received is associated with exactly one <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code>.</p>

      <p><code>RTCRtpSender</code>s are created when the application attaches a
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> to a <code>PeerConnection</code>, via the
      <code>addTrack</code> method. <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code>s, on the other
      hand, are created when remote signaling indicates new tracks are available,
      and each new <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> and its associated <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code>
      are surfaced to the application via the <code>ontrack</code> event.</p>

      <p>A <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object contains a
      <dfn id="senders-set">set of <code>RTCRtpSender</code>s</dfn>, representing tracks to
      be sent, and a <dfn id="receivers-set">set of <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code>s</dfn>,
      representing tracks that are to be received on this
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object. Both of these sets are
      initialized to empty sets when the
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object is created.</p>

          <div class="note">
            <p>Since the beginning of this specification, remote MediaStreamTracks have been
            created by the setRemoteDescription call, one track for each non-rejected
            m-line in the remote description. This meant that at the caller,
            MediaStreamTracks were not created until the answer was received, and any media
            received prior to a remote description (AKA "early media") would be discarded.
            If any form of remote description is provided (either an answer or a pranswer),
            this issue does not occur.</p>

            <p>If we want to allow early media to be played out, minor changes are necessary.
            Fundamentally, we would need to change when tracks are created
            for the offerer; this would have to happen either as a result of setLocalDescription,
            or when media packets are received. This ensures that these objects can be created and
            connected to media elements for playout.</p>

            <p>However, there are three consequences to this potential change:
              <ol>
                <li>Media may arrive before the remote DTLS fingerprint has been received.
                This means that media could be played out before the validity of the
                DTLS fingerprint has been established, which may be hard to explain to users.
                As such, it is recommended that media not be played out unless some
                TBD RTCConfiguration property (e.g. AllowUnverifiedMedia) has been set.
                </li>
                <li>The information needed to correlate MediaStreamTracks with their
                enclosing MediaStream will not yet be present when the tracks are
                initially generated. Therefore, the implementation will need to
                create dummy MediaStream objects for each MediaStreamTrack, and then
                possibly change the associated MediaStream for each track when the
                remote description is received (e.g. if it indicates that an audio
                and video MediaStreamTrack should be combined into a single MediaStream).
                Since media elements act on MediaStreams, some complex reshuffling may
                need to occur when the remote description is received.
                </li>
                <li>The track events fired and their timing will change.
                For the offerer, ontrack will now fire during setLocalDescription,
                once for each track being offered, and track.onended will fire during
                setRemoteDescription for any offered tracks that were rejected.
                For the answerer, ontrack will continue to fire during setRemoteDescription,
                as it does today (this is necessary to allow the answerer to reject
                offered tracks by stopping them).
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <p>For now, we simply make note of this issue, until it can be
            considered fully by the WG.</p>

      <h3>RTCDataChannel</h3>

      <p>The <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> interface represents a
      bi-directional data channel between two peers. A
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> is created via a factory method on an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object. The messages sent between
      the browsers are described in [[!RTCWEB-DATA]] and
      [[!RTCWEB-DATA-PROTOCOL]].</p>

      <p>There are two ways to establish a connection with
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>. The first way is to simply create a
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> at one of the peers with the
      <code><a href="#widl-RTCDataChannelInit-negotiated">negotiated</a></code>
      <code><a>RTCDataChannelInit</a></code> dictionary member unset or set to
      its default value false. This will announce the new channel in-band and
      trigger a <code><a>RTCDataChannelEvent</a></code> with the corresponding
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object at the other peer. The second
      way is to let the application negotiate the
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>. To do this, create a
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object with the <code><a href=
      "#widl-RTCDataChannelInit-negotiated">negotiated</a></code>
      <code><a>RTCDataChannelInit</a></code> dictionary member set to true, and
      signal out-of-band (e.g. via a web server) to the other side that it
      should create a corresponding <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> with the
      <code><a href="#widl-RTCDataChannelInit-negotiated">negotiated</a></code>
      <code><a>RTCDataChannelInit</a></code> dictionary member set to true and
      the same <code><a href="#dom-datachannel-id">id</a></code>. This will
      connect the two separately created <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>
      objects. The second way makes it possible to create channels with
      asymmetric properties and to create channels in a declarative way by
      specifying matching <code><a href=
      "#widl-RTCDataChannelInit-id">ids</a></code>.</p>

      <p>Each <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> has an associated
      <dfn>underlying data transport</dfn> that is used to transport actual
      data to the other peer. The transport properties of the <a>underlying
      data transport</a>, such as in order delivery settings and reliability
      mode, are configured by the peer as the channel is created. The
      properties of a channel cannot change after the channel has been created.
      The actual wire protocol between the peers is specified by the WebRTC
      DataChannel Protocol specification [[RTCWEB-DATA]].</p>

      <p>A <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> can be configured to operate in
      different reliability modes. A reliable channel ensures that the data is
      delivered at the other peer through retransmissions. An unreliable
      channel is configured to either limit the number of retransmissions (
      <code><a href=
      "#widl-RTCDataChannelInit-maxRetransmits">maxRetransmits</a></code> ) or
      set a time during which transmissions (including retransmissions) are
      allowed ( <code><a href=
      "#widl-RTCDataChannelInit-maxPacketLifeTime">maxPacketLifeTime</a></code>
      ). These properties can not be used simultaneously and an attempt to do
      so will result in an error. Not setting any of these properties results
      in a reliable channel.</p>

      <p>A <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>, created with <code><a href=
      "#dom-peerconnection-createdatachannel">createDataChannel()</a></code> or
      dispatched via a <code><a>RTCDataChannelEvent</a></code>, MUST initially
      be in the <code>connecting</code> state. When the
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object's <a>underlying data
      transport</a> is ready, the user agent MUST <a href=
      "#announce-datachannel-open">announce the <code>RTCDataChannel</code> as
      open</a>.</p>

      <p>When the user agent is to <dfn id="announce-datachannel-open">announce
      a <code>RTCDataChannel</code> as open</dfn>, the user agent MUST queue a
      task to run the following steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>If the associated <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object's
          <a href=
          "#dom-peerconnection-signaling-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
          signalingState</a> is <code>closed</code>, abort these steps.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Let <var>channel</var> be the <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>
          object to be announced.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Set <var>channel</var>'s <code><a href=

        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>When an <a>underlying data transport</a> is to be announced (the other
      peer created a channel with <code><a href=
      "#widl-RTCDataChannelInit-negotiated">negotiated</a></code> unset or set
      to false), the user agent of the peer that did not initiate the creation
      process MUST queue a task to run the following steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>If the associated <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object's
          <a href=

          signalingState</a> is <code>closed</code>, abort these steps.</p>

        <li>

          <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Let <var>configuration</var> be an information bundle received
          from the other peer as a part of the process to establish the
          <a>underlying data transport</a> described by the WebRTC DataChannel
          Protocol specification.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Initialize <var>channel</var>'s <code><a href=

          corresponding values in <var>configuration</var>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Set <var>channel</var>'s <code><a href=
          "#dom-datachannel-readystate">readyState</a></code> attribute to
          <code>connecting</code>.</p>

          at the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>An <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object's <a>underlying data
      transport</a> may be torn down in a non-abrupt manner by running the
      <dfn id="data-transport-closing-procedure">closing procedure</dfn>. When
      that happens the user agent MUST, unless the procedure was initiated by
      the <code><a href="#dom-datachannel-close">close()</a></code> method,
      queue a task that sets the object's <code><a href=
      "#dom-datachannel-readystate">readyState</a></code> attribute to
      <code>closing</code>. This will eventually render the <a href=
      "#dfn-underlying-data-transport">data transport</a> <a href=
      "#data-transport-closed">closed</a>.</p>

      <div class="note">

          <div class="note">

          <p>The tones parameter is treated as a series of characters. The

          considered <dfn id="dtmf-unrecognized">unrecognized</dfn>.</p>

          <p>The duration parameter indicates the duration in ms to use for
          each character passed in the tones parameters. The duration cannot be
          more than 6000 ms or less than 40 ms. The default duration is 100 ms

          <p>The browser MAY increase the duration and interToneGap times to
          cause the times that DTMF start and stop to align with the boundaries
          of RTP packets but it MUST not increase either of them by more than

    <h2 id="sec.stats-model">Statistics Model</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>The basic statistics model is that the browser maintains a set of
      statistics referenced by a <dfn id="stats-selector">selector</dfn>. The
      selector may, for example, be a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>. For a
      track to be a valid selector, it must be a member of a
      <code>MediaStream</code> that is sent or received by the
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object on which the stats request
      was issued. The calling Web application provides the selector to the
      <code><a href="#dom-peerconnection-getstats">getStats()</a></code> method
      and the browser emits (in the JavaScript) a set of statistics that it
      believes is relevant to the selector.</p>

      <div class="note">
        Evaluate the need for other selectors than MediaStreamTrack.
      </div>

      <p>The statistics returned are designed in such a way that repeated
      queries can be linked by the <code><a>RTCStats</a></code> <a href=
      "#dom-rtcstats-id">id</a> dictionary member. Thus, a Web application can
      make measurements over a given time period by requesting measurements at
      the beginning and end of that period.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>RTCPeerConnection Interface Extensions</h3>

      <p>The Statistics API extends the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>
      interface as described below.</p>

      <dl class="idl" title="partial interface RTCPeerConnection">
        <dt>void getStats(MediaStreamTrack? selector, RTCStatsCallback
        successCallback, RTCPeerConnectionErrorCallback failureCallback)</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Gathers stats for the given <a href="#stats-selector">selector</a>
          and reports the result asynchronously.</p>

          <p>When the <dfn id=
          "dom-peerconnection-getstats"><code>getStats()</code></dfn> method is
          invoked, the user agent MUST queue a task to run the following
          steps:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>If the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object's <a href=
              "#dom-peerconnection-signaling-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
              signalingState</a> is <code>closed</code>, throw an
              <code>InvalidStateError</code> exception.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Return, but continue the following steps in the
              background.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Let <var>selectorArg</var> be the methods first argument.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>If <var>selectorArg</var> is an invalid <a href=
              "#stats-selector">selector</a>, the user agent MUST queue a task
              to invoke the failure callback (the method's third argument).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Start gathering the stats indicated by <var>selectorArg</var>.
              In case <var>selectorArg</var> is null, stats MUST be gathered
              for the whole <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>When the relevant stats have been gathered, queue a task to
              invoke the success callback (the method's second argument) with a
              new <code><a>RTCStatsReport</a></code> object, representing the
              gathered stats, as its argument.</p>

      <h3>RTCStatsReport Object</h3>

      <p>The <code><a href="#dom-peerconnection-getstats">getStats()</a></code>
      method delivers a successful result in the form of a
      <code><a>RTCStatsReport</a></code> object. A
      <code><a>RTCStatsReport</a></code> object represents a map between
      strings, identifying the inspected objects (<a href=
      "#dom-rtcstats-id">RTCStats.id</a>), and their corresponding
      <code><a>RTCStats</a></code> objects.</p>

      <p>An <code><a>RTCStatsReport</a></code> may be composed of several
      <code><a>RTCStats</a></code> objects, each reporting stats for one
      underlying object that the implementation thinks is relevant for the
      <a href="#stats-selector">selector</a>. One achieves the total for the
      <a href="#stats-selector">selector</a> by summing over all the stats of a
      certain type; for instance, if a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is carried
      by multiple SSRCs over the network, the
      <code><a>RTCStatsReport</a></code> may contain one <code>RTCStats</code>
      object per SSRC (which can be distinguished by the value of the "ssrc"
      stats attribute).</p>

      <h3>RTCStats Dictionary</h3>

      <p>An <code><a>RTCStats</a></code> dictionary represents the stats
      gathered by inspecting a specific object relevant to a <a href=
      "#stats-selector">selector</a>. The <code><a>RTCStats</a></code>
      dictionary is a base type that specifies as set of default attributes,
      such as <a href="#dom-rtcstats-timestamp">timestamp</a> and <a href=
      "#dom-rtcstats-type">type</a>. Specific stats are added by extending the
      <code><a>RTCStats</a></code> dictionary.</p>

      <p>Note that while stats names are standardized, any given implementation
      may be using experimental values or values not yet known to the Web
      application. Thus, applications MUST be prepared to deal with unknown
      stats.</p>

      <div class="note">
        OPEN ISSUE: Need to define an IANA registry for this and populate with
        pointers to existing things such as the RTCP statistics.
      </div>

      <p>Statistics need to be synchronized with each other in order to yield
      reasonable values in computation; for instance, if "bytesSent" and
      "packetsSent" are both reported, they both need to be reported over the
      same interval, so that "average packet size" can be computed as "bytes /
      packets" - if the intervals are different, this will yield errors. Thus
      implementations MUST return synchronized values for all stats in a
      <code><a>RTCStats</a></code> object.</p>

          objects, extracted from two different

      <h3>Identity Provider Interaction</h3>

      <p>WebRTC offers and answers (and hence the channels established by
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> objects) can be authenticated by
      using a web-based Identity Provider (IdP). The idea is that the entity
      sending the offer/answer acts as the Authenticating Party (AP) and
      obtains an identity assertion from the IdP which it attaches to the
      offer/answer. The consumer of the offer/answer (i.e., the
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> on which
      <code>setRemoteDescription()</code> is called) acts as the Relying Party
      (RP) and verifies the assertion.</p>

      <p>The interaction with the IdP is designed to decouple the browser from
      any particular identity provider; the browser need only know how to load
      the IdP's JavaScript, which is deterministic from the IdP's identity, and
      the generic protocol for requesting and verifying assertions. The IdP
      provides whatever logic is necessary to bridge the generic protocol to
      the IdP's specific requirements. Thus, a single browser can support any
      number of identity protocols, including being forward compatible with
      IdPs which did not exist at the time the browser was written. The generic
      protocol details are described in [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]]. This
      document specifies the procedures required to instantiate the IdP proxy,
      request identity assertions, and consume the results.</p>

      <section>
        <h4 id="sec.identity-proxy-communications">Identity Provider
        Selection</h4>

        <p>In order to communicate with the IdP, the browser instantiates an
        isolated interpreted context, effectively an invisible IFRAME. The
        initial contents of the context are loaded from a URI derived from the
        IdP's domain name, as described in [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].</p>

        <p>For purposes of generating assertions, the IdP shall be chosen as
        follows:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>If the <code>setIdentityProvider()</code> method has been called,
          the IdP provided shall be used.</li>

          <li>If the <code>setIdentityProvider()</code> method has not been
          called, then the browser can use an IdP configured into the
          browser.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In order to verify assertions, the IdP domain name and protocol are
        taken from the <code>domain</code> and <code>protocol</code> fields of
        the identity assertion.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4 id="sec.create-identity-proxy">Instantiating an IdP Proxy</h4>

        <p>The browser creates an IdP proxy by loading an isolated, invisible
        IFRAME with HTML content from the IdP URI. The URI for the IdP is a
        well-known URI formed from the <q>domain</q> and <q>protocol</q>
        fields, as specified in [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].</p>

        <p>When an IdP proxy is requiured, the browser performs the following
        steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>An invisible, sandboxed IFRAME is created within the browser
          context. The IFRAME <code>sandbox</code> attribute is set to
          "allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin" to limit the
          capabilities available to the IdP. The browser MUST prevent the IdP
          proxy from navigating the browsing context to a different location.
          The browser MUST prevent the IdP proxy from interacting with the user
          (this includes, in particular, popup windows and user dialogs).</li>

          <li>Once the IdP proxy is created, the browser creates a
          <code>MessageChannel</code> [[!webmessaging]] within the context of
          the IdP proxy and assigns one port from the channel to a variable
          named <var>rtcwebIdentityPort</var> on the <var>window</var>. This
          message channel forms the basis of communication between the browser
          and the IdP proxy. Since it is an essential security property of the
          web sandbox that a page is unable to insert objects into content from
          another origin, this ensures that the IdP proxy can trust that
          messages originating from <var>window.rtcwebIdentityPort</var> are
          from <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> and not some other page. This
          protection ensures that pages from other origins are unable to
          instantiate IdP proxies and obtain identity assertions.</li>

          <li>The IdP proxy completes loading and informs the
          <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> that it is ready by sending a "READY"
          message to the message channel port [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]]. Once
          this message is received by the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, the
          IdP is considered ready to receive requests to generate or verify
          identity assertions.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>[TODO: This is not sufficient unless we expect the IdP to protect
        this information. Otherwise, the a=identity information can be copied
        from a session with "good" properties to any other session with the
        same fingerprint information. Since we want to reuse credentials, that
        would be bad.] The identity mechanism MUST provide an indication to the
        remote side of whether it requires the stream contents to be protected.
        Implementations MUST have an user interface that indicates the
        different cases and identity for these.</p>

      <h3 id="sec.identity-proxy-assertion-request">Requesting Identity
      Assertions</h3>

      <p>The identity assertion request process involves the following
      steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instantiates an IdP proxy as
        described in <a href="#sec.identity-proxy-communications">Identity
        Provider Selection section</a> and waits for the IdP to signal that it
        is ready.
        </li>

        <li>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> sends a "SIGN" message to the IdP
        proxy. This message includes the material
        the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> desires to be bound to the user's
        identity.</li>

        <li>If the user has been authenticated by the IdP, and the IdP is
        willing to generate an identity assertion, the IdP generates an
        identity assertion. This step depends entirely on the IdP. The methods
        by which an IdP authenticates users or generates assertions is not
        specified, though this could involve interacting with the IdP server or
        other servers.</li>

        <li>The IdP proxy sends a response containing the identity assertion to
        the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> over the message channel.</li>

        <li>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> MAY store the identity assertion
        for use with future offers or answers.</li>

        <li>If the identity request was triggered by a
        <code>createOffer()</code> or <code>createAnswer()</code>, then the
        assertion is inserted in the offer/answer SDP.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The format and contents of the messages that are exchanged are
      described in detail in [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].</p>

      <p>The IdP proxy can return an "ERROR" response. If an error is
      encountered, the browser MUST generate an <code><a href=
      "#event-idpassertionerror">idpassertionerror</a></code> event. No
      "a=identity" attribute is added to SDP as a result.</p>

      <p>The browser SHOULD limit the time that it will allow for this process.
      This includes both the loading of the <a href=
      "#sec.identity-proxy-communications">IdP proxy</a> and the identity
      assertion generation. Failure to do so potentially causes the
      corresponding operation to take an indefinite amount of time. This timer
      can be cancelled when the IdP produces a response. The timer running to
      completion can be treated as equivalent to an error from the IdP.</p>

      <section>
        <h4 id="sec.idp-loginneeded">User Login Procedure</h4>

        <p>An IdP could respond to a request to generate an identity assertion
        with a "LOGINNEEDED" error. This indicates that the site does not have
        the necessary information available to it (such as cookies) to
        authorize the creation of an identity assertion.</p>

        <p>The "LOGINNEEDED" response includes a URL for a page where the
        authorization process can be completed. This URL is exposed to the
        application through the <code><a>loginUrl</a></code>
        attribute of the <a href=
        "#event-idpassertionerror">idpassertionerror</a> event. This URL might
        be to a page where a user is able to enter their (IdP) username and
        password, or otherwise provide any information the IdP needs to
        authorize a assertion request.</p>

        <p>An application can load the login URL in an IFRAME or popup; the
        resulting page then provides the user with an opportunity to provide
        information necessary to complete the authorization process.</p>

        <p>Once the authorization process is complete, the page loaded in the
        IFRAME or popup sends a message using <var>postMessage</var>
        [[!webmessaging]] to the page that loaded it (through the <var><a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/browsers.html#dom-opener">
        window.opener</a></var> attribute for popups, or through <var><a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/browsers.html#dom-parent">
        window.parent</a></var> for pages loaded in an IFRAME). The message
        MUST be the <var>DOMString</var> "LOGINDONE". This message informs the
        application that another attempt at generating an identity assertion is
        likely to be successful.</p>

    <section>
      <h3 id="sec.identity-verify-assertion">Verifying Identity Assertions</h3>

      <p>Identity assertion validation happens when <code><a href=
      "#dom-peerconnection-setremotedescription">setRemoteDescription</a></code>
      is invoked on <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>. The process runs
      asynchronously, meaning that validation of an identity assertion does not
      block the completion of <code>setRemoteDescription</code>.</p>

      <p>The identity assertion request process involves the following
      steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instantiates an IdP proxy as
        described in <a href="#sec.identity-proxy-communications">Identity
        Provider Selection section</a> and waits for the IdP to signal that it
        is ready.
        </li>

        <li>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> sends a "VERIFY" message to the
        IdP proxy. This message includes the assertion from the offer/answer
        which is to be verified.</li>

        <li>The IdP proxy verifies the identity assertion (depending on the
        authentication protocol this could involve interacting with the IDP
        server).</li>

        <li>Once the assertion is verified, the IdP proxy sends a response
        containing the verified assertion results to the
        <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> over the message channel.</li>

        <li>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> validates that the fingerprint
        provided by the IdP in the validation response matches the certificate
        fingerprint that is, or will be, used for communications. This is
        either by:

          <ul>
            <li>Ensuring that there is only a single a=fingerprint value across
            all media sections in the SDP that matches the fingerprint provided
            by the IdP.</li>

            <li>Waiting for all DTLS connections to be establishes and checking
            that the certificate fingerprints on all connections matches the
            one provided by the IdP.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> validates that the domain
        portion of the identity matches the domain of the IdP as described in
        [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].</li>

        <li>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> stores the assertion in the
        <code><a href=
        "#widl-RTCPeerConnection-peerIdentity">peerIdentity</a></code>
        attribute and raises a simple event named <a href=
        "#event-peeridentity">peeridentity</a> at itself. The assertion information to be
        displayed MUST contain the domain name of the IdP as provided in the
        assertion.
        </li>

        <li>The browser MAY display identity information to a user in browser
        UI. Any user identity information that is displayed in this fashion
        MUST use a mechanism that cannot be spoofed by content.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The IdP might fail to validate the identity assertion by providing an
      "ERROR" response to the validation request. Validation can also fail due
      to the additional checks performed by the browser. In both cases, the
      process terminates and no identity information is exposed to the
      application or the user.</p>

      <p>The browser MUST raise an <code><a href=
      "#event-idpvalidationerror">idpvalidationerror</a></code> event if
      validation of an identity assertion fails for any reason.</p>

      <p>If the "peerIdentity" constraint is applied to the
      <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, any error MUST cause <code><a href=
      "#dom-peerconnection-setremotedescription">setRemoteDescription</a></code>
      to fail.</p>

      <p>The browser SHOULD limit the time that it will allow for this process.
      This includes both the loading of the <a href=
      "#sec.identity-proxy-communications">IdP proxy</a> and the identity
      assertion validation. Failure to do so potentially causes the
      corresponding operation to take an indefinite amount of time. This timer
      can be cancelled when the IdP produces a response. The timer running to
      completion can be treated as equivalent to an error from the IdP.</p>

          <p>When the <dfn id=
          "dom-peerconnection-setidentityprovider"><code>setIdentityProvider()</code></dfn>
          method is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

          <ol>

              identity assertion.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>Identity provider information is not used until an identity
          assertion is required, either in response to a call to

          Applications need not make this call. It is merely intended to allow
          them to start the process of obtaining identity assertions before a
          call is initiated. If an identity is needed, either because the
          browser has been configured with a default identity provider or
          because the <code>setIdentityProvider()</code> method was called,

    <h2>Media Stream API Extensions for Network Use</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>The <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> interface, as defined in the
      [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] specification, typically represents a stream of data of
      audio or video. One or more <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s can be
      collected in a <code>MediaStream</code> (strictly speaking, a <code>
      MediaStream</code> as defined in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] may contain
      zero or more <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> objects).

      A  <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> may be extended to
      represent a stream that either comes from or is sent to a remote peer
      (and not just the local camera, for instance). The extensions required to
      enable this capability on the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> object will be
      described in this section. How the media is transmitted to the peer is
      described in [[!RTCWEB-RTP]], [[!RTCWEB-AUDIO]], and
      [[!RTCWEB-TRANSPORT]].</p>

      A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> sent to another peer will appear as one and
      only one <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> to the recipient. A peer is
      defined as a user agent that supports this specification.
      In addition, the sending side application can indicate what <code>
      MediaStream</code> object(s) the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is member
      of. The corresponding <code>MediaStream</code> object(s) on the receiver
      side will be created (if not already present) and populated accordingly.</p>

      <p>As also described earlier in this document, the objects <code>
      RTCRtpSender</code> and <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code> can be used by the
      application to get more fine grained control over the transmission and
      reception of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s.</p>

      <p>Channels are the smallest unit considered in the
      <code>MediaStream</code> specification. Channels are intended to be
      encoded together for transmission as, for instance, an RTP payload type.
      All of the channels that a codec needs to encode jointly MUST be in the
      same <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> and the codecs SHOULD be able to
      encode, or discard, all the channels in the track.</p>

      <p>The concepts of an input and output to a given
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> apply in the case of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>
      objects transmitted over the network as well. A
      <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> created by an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object (as described previously in this
      document) will take as input the data received from a remote peer.
      Similarly, a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> from a local source, for instance a
      camera via [[!GETUSERMEDIA]], will have an output that represents what is
      transmitted to a remote peer if the object is used with an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>

      <p>The concept of duplicating <code>MediaStream</code> and
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> objects as described in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] is
      also applicable here. This feature can be used, for instance, in a
      video-conferencing scenario to display the
      local video from the user's camera and microphone in a local
      monitor, while only transmitting the audio to the remote peer (e.g. in
      response to the user using a "video mute" feature). Combining
      different <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> objects into new <code>MediaStream</code>
      objects is useful in certain situations.</p>

      <p class="note">In this document, we only specify aspects of the
      following objects that are relevant when used along with an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>. Please refer to the original
      definitions of the objects in the [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] document for general
      information on using <code>MediaStream</code> and
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>.</p>

      <h3>MediaStream</h3>

      <section>
        <h4>id</h4>

        <p>The <code><a href=
        "http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediastream-id">id</a></code> attribute
        specified in <code>MediaStream</code> returns an id that is unique to
        this stream, so that streams can be recognized at the
        remote end of the <code><a href=
        "#rtcpeerconnection-interface">RTCPeerConnection</a></code> API.</p>

        <p>When a <code><a href="#mediastream">MediaStream</a></code> is
        created to represent a stream obtained from a remote peer, the
        <code><a href="http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediastream-id">id</a></code>
        attribute is initialized from information provided by the remote
        source.</p>

        <p class="note">The id of a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object is
        unique to the source of the stream, but that does not mean it is not
        possible to end up with duplicates. For example, a locally generated
        stream could be sent from one user agent to a remote peer using
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> and then sent back to the
        original user agent in the same manner, in which case the original user
        agent will have multiple streams with the same id (the
        locally-generated one and the one received from the remote peer).</p>

        <h4>Events on MediaStream</h4>

        <p>A new media track may be associated with an existing
        <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>. For example, if a remote peer adds a
        new <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object to a
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>, and indicates that the
        <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> is a member of a <code><a>
        MediaStream</a></code> that has already been created locally
        by the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>, this is observed on the local
        user agent. If this happens for the reason exemplified, or for any
        other reason than the <code><a href=
        "http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediastream-addtrack">addTrack()</a></code>
        method being invoked locally on a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> or
        tracks being added as the stream is created (i.e. the stream is
        initialized with tracks),
        the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Let <var>stream</var> be the target
            <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let <var>track</var> be the <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>
            object representing the media component about to be added.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add <var>track</var> to <var>stream's</var> <a href=
            "getusermedia.html#track-set">track set</a>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fire a track event named <code><a href=
            "http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastream-addtrack">addtrack</a></code>
            with the newly created <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object
            at <var>stream</var>.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>An existing media track may also be disassociated from a
        <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>. If this happens for any other reason
        than the <code><a href=
        "http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediastream-removetrack">removeTrack()</a></code>
        method being invoked locally on a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> or
        the stream being destroyed, the user agent MUST run the following
        steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Let <var>stream</var> be the target
            <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let <var>track</var> be the <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>
            object representing the media component about to be removed.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Remove <var>track</var> from <var>stream's</var> <a href=
            "http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#track-set">track set</a>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fire a track event named <code><a href=
            "http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastream-removetrack">removetrack</a></code>
            with <var>track</var> at <var>stream</var>.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The event source for the <code>onended</code> event in the networked
        case is the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>

      <h3>MediaStreamTrack</h3>

      <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> object's reference to its
      <code>MediaStream</code> in the non-local media source case (an RTP
      source, as is the case for a <code>MediaStream</code> received over an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> ) is always strong.</p>

      <p>A <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>, received from the
      <code><a href="#event-track">ontrack</a></code> event on an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>, MUST have its
      <code>muted</code> attribute [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] set to
      <code>true</code> until media data arrives from the RTP source.</p>

      <p>In addition, a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> has its
      <code>muted</code> attribute set to <code>true</code> on the
      remote peer if the local user agent makes inactive the corresponding
      <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> that is being sent.</p>

      <p>When a track comes
      from a remote peer and the remote peer has permanently stopped sending
      data the <code>ended</code> event MUST be fired on the track, as
      specified in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].</p>

      <p class="issue">ISSUE: How do you know when it has stopped? This seems
      like an SDP question, not a media-level question. (Suggestion: when the
      track is ended, either through port 0, or removing the a=msid attrib)</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Isolated Media Streams</h3>

      <p>A MediaStream acquired using <code>getUserMedia()</code> is, by
      default, accessible to an application. This means that the application is
      able to access the contents of tracks, modify their content, and send
      that media to any peer it chooses.</p>

      <p>WebRTC supports calling scenarios where media is sent to a
      specifically identified peer, without the contents of media streams being
      accessible to applications. This is enabled by use of the
      <code>peerIdentity</code> parameter to
      <code>getUserMedia()</code>.</p>

      <p>An application willingly relinquishes access to media by including a
      <code>peerIdentity</code> parameter in the
      <code>MediaStreamConstraints</code>. This attribute is set to a
      <code>DOMString</code> containing the identity of a specific peer.</p>

      <p>The <code><dfn>MediaStreamConstraints</dfn></code> dictionary is
      expanded to include the <code>peerIdentity</code> parameter.</p>

      <dl class="idl" title="partial dictionary MediaStreamConstraints">
        <dt>DOMString peerIdentity</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If set, <code>peerIdentity</code> isolates media from the
          application. Media can only be sent to the identified peer.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>A user that is prompted to provide consent for access to a camera or
      microphone can be shown the value of the <code>peerIdentity</code>
      parameter, so that they can be informed that the consent is more narrowly
      restricted.</p>

      <p>When the <code><dfn>peerIdentity</dfn></code> option is supplied to
      <code>getUserMedia()</code>, all of the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s in
      the resulting <code>MediaStream</code> are isolated so that content is
      not accessible to any application. Isolated
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s can be used for two purposes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Displayed in an appropriate media tag (e.g., a video or audio
          element). The browser MUST ensure that content is inaccessible to the
          application by ensuring that the resulting content is given the same
          protections as content that is <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/infrastructure.html#cors-cross-origin">
          CORS cross-origin</a>, as described in the relevant <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content.html#security-and-privacy-considerations">
          Security and privacy considerations section</a> of [[HTML5]].</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Used as the argument to <a href=
          "#widl-RTCPeerConnection-addTrack-void-MediaStream-stream">addTrack()</a>
          on an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> instance, subject to the
          restrictions in <a href="#isolated-pc">isolated streams and RTCPeerConnection</a>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> that is added to another
      <code>MediaStream</code> remains isolated. When an isolated
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is added to a <code>MediaStream</code> with
      a different peerIdentity, the <code>MediaStream</code> gets a combination
      of isolation restrictions. A <code>MediaStream</code> containing
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> instances with mixed isolation properties
      can be displayed, but cannot be sent using
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>.</p>

      <p>Any <code>peerIdentity</code> property MUST be retained on cloned
      copies of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s.</p>
      <!-- Any stream or track that might be derived from an isolated stream,
           such as
           through <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/streamproc/#media-element-extensions">captureStreamUntilEnded
           or captureStream</a>, MUST also retain any isolation protections.

        <h4>Extended MediaStreamTrack Properties</h4>

        <p><code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is expanded to include an

        <h4>Isolated Streams and RTCPeerConnection</h4>

        <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> with a <var>peerIdentity</var>
        option set can be added to any <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>.
        However, the content of an isolated track MUST NOT be transmitted
        unless all of the following constraints are met:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> from a stream acquired using the
            <var>peerIdentity</var> option can be transmitted if the
            <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> has successfully <a href=
            "#sec.identity-verify-assertion">validated the identity</a> of the
            peer AND that identity is the same identity that was used in the
            <var>peerIdentity</var> option associated with the track. That is,
            the <code>name</code> attribute of the <code>peerIdentity</code>
            attribute of the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> instance
            MUST match the value of the <code>peerIdentity</code> option passed
            to <code>getUserMedia()</code>.</p>

            <p>Rules for matching identity are described in
            [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The peer has indicated that it will respect the isolation
            properties of streams. That is, a DTLS connection with a promise to
            respect stream confidentiality, as defined in [[!RTCWEB-ALPN]] has
            been established.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Failing to meet these conditions means that no media can be sent for
        the affected <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>. Video MUST be replaced by
        black frames, audio MUST be replaced by silence, and equivalently
        information-free content MUST be provided for other media types.</p>

        <p>Remotely sourced <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s MUST be isolated if
        they are received over a DTLS connection that has been negotiated with
        track isolation. This protects isolated media from the application in
        the receiving browser. These tracks MUST only be displayed to a user
        using the appropriate media element (e.g., &lt;video&gt; or
        &lt;audio&gt;).</p>

        <p>Any <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> that has the
        <var>peerIdentity</var> option set causes all tracks sent using the
        same <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> to be isolated at the
        receiving peer. All DTLS connections created for a
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> with isolated local streams MUST
        be negotiated so that media remains isolated at the remote peer. This
        causes non-isolated media to become isolated at the receiving peer if
        any isolated tracks are added to the same
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>.</p>

        <p class="note">Tracks that are not bound to a particular
        <var>peerIdentity</var> do not cause other streams to be isolated,
        these tracks simply do not have their content transmitted.</p>

        <p>If a stream becomes isolated after initially being accessible, or an
        isolated stream is added to an active session, then media for that
        stream is replaced by information-free content (e.g., black frames or
        silence).</p>
      </section>

      <section id="isolation-protection">
        <h4>Protection Afforded by Media Isolation</h4>

        <p>Media isolation ensures that the content of a
        <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is not accessible to web applications.
        However, to ensure that media with a <var>peerIdentity</var> option set
        can be sent to peers, some meta-information about the media will be
        exposed to applications.</p>

        <p>Applications will be able to observe the parameters of the media
        that affect session negotiation and conversion into RTP. This includes
        the codecs that might be supported by the track, the bitrate, the
        number of packets, and the current settings that are set on the
        <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>.</p>

        <p>In particular, the <a href="#statistics-model">statistics</a> that
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> records are not reduced in
        capability. New statistics that might compromise isolation MUST be
        avoided, or explicitly suppressed for isolated streams.</p>

        <p>Most of these data are exposed to the network when the media is
        transmitted. Only the settings for the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>
        present a new source of information. This can includes the frame rate
        and resolution of video tracks, the bandwidth of audio tracks, and
        other information about the source, which would not otherwise be
        revealed to a network observer. Since settings don't change at a high
        frequency or in response to changes in media content, settings only
        reveal limited reveal information about the content of a track.
        However, any setting that might change dynamically in response to the
        content of an isolated <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> MUST have changes
        suppressed.</p>

      <h3>DTMF Example</h3>

      <p>Examples assume that <var>sender</var> is an RTCRtpSender.

      <p>Sending the DTMF signal "1234" with 500 ms duration per tone:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight" xml:space="preserve">
if (sender.dtmf) {
    var duration = 500;
    sender.dtmf.insertDTMF("1234", duration);
} else
    log("DTMF function not available");

</pre>

      <p>Send the DTMF signal "1234", and light up the active key using
      <code>lightKey(key)</code> while the tone is playing (assuming that
      <code>lightKey("")</code> will darken all the keys):</p>
      <pre class="example highlight" xml:space="preserve">
if (sender.dtmf) {
  sender.dtmf.ontonechange = function (e) {
      if (!e.tone)
          return;
      // light up the key when playout starts
      lightKey(e.tone);
      // turn off the light after tone duration
      setTimeout(lightKey, sender.duration, "");
  };
  sender.dtmf.insertDTMF("1234");
} else
    log("DTMF function not available");

</pre>

      <p>Send a 1-second "1" tone followed by a 2-second "2" tone:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight" xml:space="preserve">
if (sender.dtmf) {
  sender.dtmf.ontonechange = function (e) {
      if (e.tone == "1")
          sender.dtmf.insertDTMF("2", 2000);
  };
  sender.dtmf.isertDTMF("1", 1000);
} else
    log("DTMF function not available");

</pre>

      <p>It is always safe to append to the tone buffer. This example appends
      before any tone playout has started as well as during playout.</p>
      <pre class="example highlight" xml:space="preserve">

if (sender.dtmf) {
  sender.dtmf.insertDTMF("123");
  // append more tones to the tone buffer before playout has begun
  sender.dtmf.insertDTMF(sender.toneBuffer + "456");

  sender.dtmf.ontonechange = function (e) {
      if (e.tone == "1")
          // append more tones when playout has begun
          sender.dtmf.insertDTMF(sender.toneBuffer + "789");
  };
} else
    log("DTMF function not available");

</pre>

      <p>Send the DTMF signal "123" and abort after sending "2".</p>
      <pre class="example highlight" xml:space="preserve">
if (sender.dtmf) {
  sender.dtmf.ontonechange = function (e) {
      if (e.tone == "2")
          // empty the buffer to not play any tone after "2"
          sender.dtmf.insertDTMF("");
  };
  sender.dtmf.insertDTMF("123");

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
    <p>This section is non-normative; it specifies no new behaviour,
    but instead summarizes information already present in other parts
    of the specification.</p>

    <p>This document extends the Web platform with the ability to set
    up real time, direct communication between browsers and other
    devices, including other browsers.</p>

    <p>This means that data and media can be shared between
    applications running in different browsers, or between an
    application running in the same browser and something that is not a
    browser, something that is an extension to the usual barriers in
    the Web model against sending data between entities with different
    origins.</p>

    <p>The WebRTC specification provides no user prompts or chrome
    indicators for communication; it assumes that once the Web page
    has been allowed to access media, it is free to share that media
    with other entities as it chooses.</p>

    <p>A mechanism, <code><a>peerIdentity</a></code>, is provided that gives
    Javascript the option of requesting media that the same javascript
    cannot access, but can only be sent to certain other entities.</p>

    <p>Even without WebRTC, the Web server providing a Web application
    will know the public IP
    address to which the application is delivered. Setting up
    communications exposes additional information about the browser’s
    network context to the web application, and may include the set of
    (possibly private) IP addresses available to the browser for WebRTC
    use. Some of this information has to be passed to the
    corresponding party to enable the establishment of a communication
    session.</p>

    <p>Revealing IP addresses can leak location and means of
    connection; this can be sensitive.</p>

    <p>A connection will always reveal the IP addresses proposed for
    communication to the corresponding party. The application can limit
    this exposure by choosing not to use certain addresses using the
    <a>RTCIceTransportPolicy</a>, and by
    using relays (for instance TURN servers) rather than direct
    connections between participants. One will normally assume that
    the IP address of TURN servers is not sensitive information.</p>

    <p>Mitigating the exposure of IP addresses to the application requires
    limiting the IP addresses that can be used, which will impact the
    ability to communicate on the most direct path between endpoints.
    Browsers are encouraged to provide appropriate controls for deciding
    which IP addresses are made available to applications, based on the
    security posture desired by the user.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>The working group is actively discussing what additional text
      regarding exposure of IP addresses is appropriate for this section.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>Since the browser is an active platform executing in a trusted
    network environment (inside the firewall), it is important to
    limit the damage that the browser can do to other elements on the
    local network, and it is important to protect data from
    interception, manipulation and modification by untrusted
    participants.</p>

    <p>Mitigations include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An UA will always request permission from the correspondent
      UA to communicate using ICE. This
      ensures that the UA can only send to partners who you have
      shared credentials with.</li>
      <li>An UA will always request ongoing permission to continue sending
      using ICE continued
      consent. This enables a receiver to withdraw consent to
      receive.</li>
      <li>An UA will always encrypt data, with strong per-session keying
      (DTLS-SRTP).</li>
      <li>An UA wil always use congestion control. This ensures that
      WebRTC cannot be used to flood the network.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These measures are specified in the relevant IETF documents.</p>


    <p>The fact that communication is taking place cannot be hidden from
    adversaries that can observe the network, so this has to be
    regarded as public information.</p>
