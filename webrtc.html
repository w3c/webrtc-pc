    <p>This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to allow media
    to be sent to and received from another browser or device implementing the
    appropriate set of real-time protocols. This specification is being
    developed in conjunction with a protocol specification developed by the
    IETF RTCWEB group and an API specification to get access to local media
    devices developed by the Media Capture Task Force.</p>

  <section id="sotd">
    <p>This document is neither complete nor stable, and as such is not yet
    suitable for commercial implementation. However, early experimentation is
    encouraged. The API is based on preliminary work done in the WHATWG. The
    Web Real-Time Communications Working Group expects this specification to
    evolve significantly based on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The outcome of ongoing exchanges in the companion RTCWEB group at
      IETF to define the set of protocols that, together with this document,
      will enable real-time communications in Web browsers.</li>

      <li>Privacy issues that arise when exposing local capabilities and local
      streams.</li>

      <li>Technical discussions within the group.</li>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>There are a number of facets to video-conferencing in HTML covered by
    this specification:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Connecting to remote peers using NAT-traversal technologies such as
      ICE, STUN, and TURN.</li>

      <li>Sending the locally-produced streams to remote peers and receiving
      streams from remote peers.</li>

      <li>Sending arbitrary data directly to remote peers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This document defines the APIs used for these features. This
    specification is being developed in conjunction with a protocol
    specification developed by the <a href=
    "https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rtcweb/">IETF RTCWEB group</a> and an API
    specification to get access to local media devices
    [[!GETUSERMEDIA]]developed by the <a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc/">Media Capture Task Force</a>. An
    overview of the system can be found in [[RTCWEB-OVERVIEW]] and
    [[RTCWEB-SECURITY]].</p>
  </section>

  <section id="conformance">
    <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
    product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it
    contains.</p>

    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
    implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
    particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
    easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>

    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
    this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
    ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]], as
    this specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>An <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> allows two users to
      communicate directly, browser to browser. Communications are coordinated
      via a signaling channel which is provided by unspecified means, but
      generally by a script in the page via the server, e.g. using
      <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> [[XMLHttpRequest]].</p>
    </section>

      <h3>Configuration</h3>

      <section>
        <h4>RTCConfiguration Type</h4>

        <dl class="idl" title="dictionary RTCConfiguration">
          <dt>sequence&lt;RTCIceServer&gt; iceServers</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>An array containing URIs of servers available to be used by ICE,
            such as STUN and TURN server.</p>

          <dt>RTCIceTransportPolicy iceTransportPolicy = "all"</dt>

          <dt>RTCBundlePolicy bundlePolicy = "balanced"</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Indicates which <a href="#target-bundle-policy">BundlePolicy</a> to use. </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>DOMString peerIdentity</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Sets the <a href="#target-peer-identity">target peer
            identity</a> for the <a>RTCPeerConnection</a>. The
            <a>RTCPeerConnection</a> will not establish a connection to a remote
            peer unless it can be successfully authenticated with the provided
            name.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt>sequence&lt;RTCCertificate&gt; certificates</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>A set of certificates that
            the <a><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a> uses to authenticate.</p>

            <p>Valid values for this parameter are created through calls to
            the <a href="#widl-RTCPeerConnection-generateCertificate-Promise-RTCCertificate--AlgorithmIdentifier-keygenAlgorithm"><code>generateCertificate</code></a>
            function.</p>

            <p>Although any given DTLS connection will use only one certificate,
            this attribute allows the caller to provide multiple certificates
            that support different algorithms.  The final certificate will be
            selected based on the DTLS handshake, which establishes which
            certificates are allowed.  The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
            implementation selects which of the certificates is used for a given
            connection; how certificates are selected is outside the scope of
            this specification.</p>

            <p>If this value is absent, then a set of certificates are generated
            for each <a><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a> instance.</p>

            <p>This option allows applications to establish key continuity.
            An <code>RTCCertificate</code> can be persisted in [[INDEXEDDB]] and
            reused.  Persistence and reuse also avoids the cost of key
            generation.</p>

            <p>The value for this configuration option cannot change after its
            value is initially selected.  Attempts to change this value MUST be
            rejected.</p>

        The BundlePolicy effects which media tracks are negotiated if
        the remote endpoint is not BUNDLE-aware, and what ICE
        candidates are gathered.  If the remote endpoint is
        BUNDLE-aware, all media tracks and data channels are BUNDLEd
        onto the same transport.

          <dd>Gather ICE candidates for each media type in use (audio,

            emergency calling or sounds other than spoken voice, it is

      <h3>RTCPeerConnection Interface</h3>

      <p>The general operation of the RTCPeerConnection is described in
      [[!RTCWEB-JSEP]].</p>

      <section>
        <h4>Operation</h4>

        <p>Calling <code>new <a>RTCPeerConnection</a>(<var>configuration</var>
        )</code> creates an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>

        <p>The <var>configuration</var> has the information to find and access
        the servers used by ICE. There may be multiple servers of each type and
        any TURN server also acts as a STUN server.</p>

        <p>An <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object has an associated
        <dfn id="rtcpeerconnection-ice-agent">ICE agent</dfn> [[!ICE]],
        RTCPeerConnection signaling state, ICE gathering state, and ICE
        connection state. These are initialized when the object is created.</p>

        <p>When the <dfn id=
        "dom-peerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection()</code></dfn> constructor
        is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Let <var>connection</var> be a newly created
            <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><a href="#set-pc-configuration">Set the configuration</a>
            specified by the constructor's first argument.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Create an ICE Agent as defined in [[!ICE]] and let
            <var>connection</var>'s <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> ICE Agent be
            that ICE Agent. The ICE Agent will
            proceed with gathering as soon as the <a href=
            "#ice-transports-setting">ICE transports setting</a> is not set to
            <code>none</code>. At this point the ICE Agent does not know how
            many ICE components it needs (and hence the number of candidates to
            gather), but it can make a reasonable assumption such as 2. As the
            <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> object gets more information, the
            ICE Agent can adjust the number of components.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Set <var>connection</var>'s <a href=

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Initialize an internal variable to represent a queue of
            <code>operations</code> with an empty set.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the <code>certificates</code> value in
            the <code>RTCConfiguration</code> structure is non-empty, check that
            the <code>expires</code> on each value is in the future.  If a
            certificate has expired, throw an <code>InvalidParameter</code>
            exception and abort these steps; otherwise, store the certificates.
            If no <code>certificates</code> value was specified, one or more
            new <code>RTCCertificate</code> instances are generated for use with
            this <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instance.</p>
          </li>

            <p>Return <var>connection</var>.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Once the RTCPeerConnection object has been initialized, for every
        call to <code>createOffer</code>, <code>setLocalDescription</code>,
        <code>createAnswer</code>, <code>setRemoteDescription</code>,

            or with an error), remove the corresponding object from the
            <code>operations</code> array. After removal, if the array is
            non-empty, execute the first object queued asynchronously and
            repeat this step on completion.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The general idea is to have only one among <code>createOffer</code>,
        <code>setLocalDescription</code>, <code>createAnswer</code> and
        <code>setRemoteDescription</code> executing at any given time. If
        subsequent calls are made while one of them is still executing, they
        are added to a queue and processed when the previous operation is fully
        completed. It is valid, and expected, for normal error handling
        procedures to be applied.</p>

        <p>Additionally, during the lifetime of the RTCPeerConnection object,
        the following procedures are followed when an ICE event occurs:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>If the <a href=
            "#dom-peerconnection-ice-gathering-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
            ice gathering state</a> is <code>new</code> and the <a href=
            "#ice-transports-setting">ICE transports setting</a> is not set to
            <code>none</code>, the user agent MUST queue a task to start
            gathering ICE addresses and set the <a href=
            "#dom-peerconnection-ice-gathering-state">ice gathering state</a>
            to <code>gathering</code>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the ICE Agent has found one or more candidate pairs for each
            <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> that forms a valid connection, the ICE connection
            state is changed to "connected".</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>When the ICE Agent finishes checking all candidate pairs, if at
            least one connection has been found for each <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>, the
            <a href=
            "#dom-peerconnection-ice-connection-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
            ice connection state</a> is changed to "completed"; otherwise
            "failed".</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="issue">
          <p>The section above shouldn't need to reference MediaStreamTracks when
          discussing the ICE connection state; one problem with this is that
          it doesn't handle the data channel situation properly.
          Rewrite this to refer to m-lines or ICE "media streams" or some such
          (here and in the later ICE connection state discussions.)
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>When the ICE Agent needs to notify the script about the candidate
        gathering progress, the user agent must queue a task to run the
        following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Let <var>connection</var> be the
            <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object associated with this
            ICE Agent.</p>
          </li>

          <li>

            "#dom-peerconnection-signaling-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
            signalingState</a> is <code>closed</code>, abort these steps.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If the intent of the ICE Agent is to notify the script that:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>A new candidate is available.</p>

                <p>Add the candidate to <var>connection</var>'s
                <code><a>localDescription</a></code> and create a
                <code><a>RTCIceCandidate</a></code> object to represent the
                candidate. Let <var>newCandidate</var> be that object.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>The gathering process is done.</p>

                <p>Set <var>connection</var>'s <a href=

          <dd>
            <p>The createOffer method generates a blob of SDP that contains an
            RFC 3264 offer with the supported configurations for the session,
            including descriptions of the local <code>MediaStream</code>s
            attached to this <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, the codec/RTP/RTCP
            options supported by this implementation, and any candidates that
            have been gathered by the ICE Agent. The options parameter may be
            supplied to provide additional control over the offer
            generated.</p>

            <p>As an offer, the generated SDP will contain the full set of
            capabilities supported by the session (as opposed to an answer,
            which will include only a specific negotiated subset to use); for
            each SDP line, the generation of the SDP must follow the
            appropriate process for generating an offer. In the event
            createOffer is called after the session is established, createOffer
            will generate an offer that is compatible with the current session,
            incorporating any changes that have been made to the session since
            the last complete offer-answer exchange, such as addition or
            removal of streams. If no changes have been made, the offer will
            include the capabilities of the current local description as well
            as any additional capabilities that could be negotiated in an
            updated offer.</p>

            <p>Session descriptions generated by createOffer MUST be
            immediately usable by setLocalDescription without causing an error
            as long as setLocalDescription is called reasonably soon.
            If a system has limited resources (e.g. a finite number
            of decoders), createOffer needs to return an offer that reflects
            the current state of the system, so that setLocalDescription will
            succeed when it attempts to acquire those resources. The session
            descriptions MUST remain usable by setLocalDescription without
            causing an error until at least the end of the fulfillment callback of the
            returned promise. Calling this method is needed to get the ICE user name
            fragment and password.</p>

            <p>The value for <code>certificates</code> in
            the <code><a>RTCConfiguration</a></code> for
            the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> is used to produce a set of
            certificate fingerprints.  These certificate fingerprints are used
            in the construction of SDP and as input to requests for identity
            assertions.</p>

            <p>If the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> is configured to generate
            Identity assertions by calling <a>setIdentityProvider</a>, then the
            session description SHALL contain an appropriate assertion.  If the
            identity provider is unable to produce an identity assertion, the
            call to <code>createOffer</code> MUST be rejected with a
            <code>DOMError</code> that has a name of IdpError.</p>

            <p>If this <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> object is closed before
            the SDP generation process completes, the USER agent MUST suppress
            the result and not resolve or reject the returned promise.</p>

            <p>If the SDP generation process completed successfully, the user
            agent MUST resolve the returned promise with a
            newly created <code><a>RTCSessionDescription</a></code> object,
            representing the generated offer.</p>

            <p>If the SDP generation process failed for any other reason, the
            user agent MUST reject the returned promise with an
            <code>DOMError</code> object of type TBD as its argument.</p>

            supported configuration for the session that is compatible with the
            parameters in the remote configuration. Like createOffer, the
            returned blob contains descriptions of the local MediaStreams
            attached to this RTCPeerConnection, the codec/RTP/RTCP options
            negotiated for this session, and any candidates that have been
            gathered by the ICE Agent. The options parameter may be supplied to
            provide additional control over the generated answer.</p>

            <p>As an answer, the generated SDP will contain a specific
            configuration that, along with the corresponding offer, specifies
            how the media plane should be established. The generation of the
            SDP must follow the appropriate process for generating an
            answer.</p>

            <p>Session descriptions generated by createAnswer must be
            immediately usable by setLocalDescription without causing an
            error as long as setLocalDescription is called reasonably soon.

      <section>
        <h4>General Principles</h4>

        <p>All methods that return promises are governed by the standard error
        handling rules of promises. Methods that do not return promises may throw
        exceptions to indicate errors.</p>

        <p>Legacy-methods may only throw exceptions to indicate invalid state
        and other programming errors. For example, when a legacy-method is
        called when the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> is in an invalid
        state or a state in which that particular method is not allowed to be
        executed, it will throw an exception. In all other cases, legacy methods
        MUST provide an error object to the error callback.</p>

      <h3>Session Negotiation Model</h3>
      <p>Many changes to state of an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> will
        require communication with
        the remote side via the signaling channel, in order to have the desired
        effect. The app can be kept informed as to when it needs to do signaling,
        by listening to the negotiationneeded event.</p>
      <section>
        <h4>Setting Negotiation-Needed</h4>
        <p>If an operation is performed on an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>
          that requires signaling,
          the connection will be marked as needing negotiation. Examples of such
          operations include adding or stopping a track, or adding the first
          data channel.</p>
        <p>Internal changes within the implementation can also result in the
          connection being marked as needing negotiation. For example, if a
          <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> enters the ended state because
          its source device became unavailable.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Clearing Negotiation-Needed</h4>
        <p>The negotiation-needed state is cleared when
          <code>setLocalDescription</code> is
          called (either for an offer or answer), and the supplied description
          matches the state of the tracks/datachannels that currenly exist on the
          <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>. Specifically, this means that
          all live tracks have an associated section in the local description
          with their MSID, all ended tracks have been removed from the local
          description, and, if any data channels have been created, a data
          section exists in the local description.</p>
        <p>Note that <code>setLocalDescription(answer)</code> will clear the
          negotiation-needed state only if the offer had a corresponding section for
          all the tracks/datachannels on the answerer side. Otherwise, a new offer by
          the answerer is still needed, and so the state is not cleared.</p>

        <h4>Firing An Event</h4>
        <p>When the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> <var>connection</var>
           is marked as negotiation-needed, and it was not already marked as such:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the signaling state is stable, schedule a task to check the
            negotiation-needed state and, if still set, fire an
            <a href="#event-negotiation">negotiationneeded</a> event on
            <var>connection</var>.</li>
          <li>Otherwise, do nothing. If necessary, an event will be fired during
            <code>setLocalDescription</code> or
            <code>setRemoteDescription</code> processing, as described above.</li>

      <h2>RTP Media API</h2>

      <p>The RTP media API lets a web application send and receive <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s
      over a peer-to-peer connection. Tracks, when added to a RTCPeerConnection, result in
      signaling; when this signaling is forwarded to a remote peer, it causes
      corresponding tracks to be created on the remote side.</p>

      <p>The actual encoding and transmission of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s is managed through
      objects called <code>RTCRtpSender</code>s. Similarly, the reception and decoding of
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s is managed through objects called <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code>s.
      Each track to be sent is associated with exactly one <code>RTCRtpSender</code>, and
      each track to be received is associated with exactly one <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code>.</p>

      <p><code>RTCRtpSender</code>s are created when the application attaches a
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> to a <code>PeerConnection</code>, via the
      <code>addTrack</code> method. <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code>s, on the other
      hand, are created when remote signaling indicates new tracks are available,
      and each new <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> and its associated <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code>
      are surfaced to the application via the <code>ontrack</code> event.</p>

      <p>A <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object contains a
      <dfn id="senders-set">set of <code>RTCRtpSender</code>s</dfn>, representing tracks to
      be sent, and a <dfn id="receivers-set">set of <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code>s</dfn>,
      representing tracks that are to be received on this
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object. Both of these sets are
      initialized to empty sets when the
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object is created.</p>

          <div class="issue">
            <p>Since the beginning of this specification, remote MediaStreamTracks have been
            created by the setRemoteDescription call, one track for each non-rejected
            m-line in the remote description. This meant that at the caller,
            MediaStreamTracks were not created until the answer was received, and any media
            received prior to a remote description (AKA "early media") would be discarded.
            If any form of remote description is provided (either an answer or a pranswer),
            this issue does not occur.</p>

            <p>If we want to allow early media to be played out, minor changes are necessary.
            Fundamentally, we would need to change when tracks are created
            for the offerer; this would have to happen either as a result of setLocalDescription,
            or when media packets are received. This ensures that these objects can be created and
            connected to media elements for playout.</p>

            <p>However, there are three consequences to this potential change:
              <ol>
                <li>Media may arrive before the remote DTLS fingerprint has been received.
                This means that media could be played out before the validity of the
                DTLS fingerprint has been established, which may be hard to explain to users.
                As such, it is recommended that media not be played out unless some
                TBD RTCConfiguration property (e.g. AllowUnverifiedMedia) has been set.
                </li>
                <li>The information needed to correlate MediaStreamTracks with their
                enclosing MediaStream will not yet be present when the tracks are
                initially generated. Therefore, the implementation will need to
                create dummy MediaStream objects for each MediaStreamTrack, and then
                possibly change the associated MediaStream for each track when the
                remote description is received (e.g. if it indicates that an audio
                and video MediaStreamTrack should be combined into a single MediaStream).
                Since media elements act on MediaStreams, some complex reshuffling may
                need to occur when the remote description is received.
                </li>
                <li>The track events fired and their timing will change.
                For the offerer, ontrack will now fire during setLocalDescription,
                once for each track being offered, and track.onended will fire during
                setRemoteDescription for any offered tracks that were rejected.
                For the answerer, ontrack will continue to fire during setRemoteDescription,
                as it does today (this is necessary to allow the answerer to reject
                offered tracks by stopping them).
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <p>For now, we simply make note of this issue, until it can be
            considered fully by the WG.</p>

      <p>
        The certificates that <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instances use to
        authenticate with peers use the <a><code>RTCCertificate</code></a>
        interface.  These objects can be explicitly generated by applications
        using <code>RTCPeerConnection.generateCertificate</code> and provided in
        the <a><code>RTCConfiguration</code></a> when constructing a
        new <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The explicit certificate management functions provided here are
        optional.  If an application does not provide
        the <code>certificates</code> configuration option when constructing
        an <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> a new set of certificates MUST be
        generated by the <a>user agent</a>.  That set MUST include an ECDSA
        certificate with a private key on the P-256 curve and a signature with a
        SHA-256 hash.
      </p>

      <dl class="idl" title="partial interface RTCPeerConnection">

          (AlgorithmIdentifier keygenAlgorithm)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The <code>generateCertificate</code> function causes the <a>user
          agent</a> to create and store an X.509 certificate [[!X509V3]] and
          corresponding private key.  A handle to information is provided in the
          form of the <code>RTCCertificate</code> interface.  The
          returned <code>RTCCertificate</code> can be used to control the
          certificate that is offered in the DTLS sessions established
          by <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.</p>

          <p>The <var>keygenAlgorithm</var> argument is used to control how the
          private key associated with the certificate is generated.
          The <var>keygenAlgorithm</var> argument uses the WebCrypto
          [[!WebCryptoAPI]] <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcrypto-api/raw-file/tip/spec/Overview.html#dfn-AlgorithmIdentifier">AlgorithmIdentifier</a>
          type.  The <var>keygenAlgorithm</var> value MUST be a valid argument
          to <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcrypto-api/raw-file/tip/spec/Overview.html#SubtleCrypto-method-generateKey"><code>Crypto.subtle.generateKey</code></a>;
          that is, the value MUST produce a non-error result when normalized
          according to the
          WebCrypto <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcrypto-api/raw-file/tip/spec/Overview.html#algorithm-normalization">algorithm
          normalization process</a> [[!WebCryptoAPI]] with an operation name
          of <code>generateKey</code> and a

          value specific to production of certificates
          for <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.</p>

          <p>Signatures produced by the generated key are used to authenticate
          the DTLS connection. The identified algorithm (as identified by
          the <code>name</code> of the
          normalized <code>AlgorithmIdentifier</code>) MUST be an asymmetric
          algorithm that can be used to produce a signature.</p>

          <p>The certificate produced by this process also contains a signature.
          The validity of this signature is only relevant for compatibility
          reasons.  Only the public key and the resulting certificate
          fingerprint are used by <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, but it is more
          likely that a certificate will be accepted if the certificate is well
          formed.  The browser selects the algorithm used to sign the
          certificate; a browser SHOULD select SHA-256 [[!FIPS-180-3]] if a hash
          algorithm is needed.</p>

          <p>The resulting certificate MUST NOT include information that can be
          linked to a user or <a>user agent</a>.  Randomized values for
          distinguished name and serial number SHOULD be used.</p>

          <p>A <a>user agent</a> MUST reject a call
          to <code>generateCertificate()</code> with a <code>DOMError</code> of
          type "InvalidAccessError" if the <var>keygenAlgorithm</var> parameter
          identifies an algorithm that the <a>user agent</a> cannot or will not
          use to generate a certificate for <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.</p>

        <h2>RTCCertificate Interface</h2>

        <p>The <dfn><code>RTCCertificate</code></dfn> interface represents a
        certificate used to authenticate WebRTC communications.  In addition to
        the visible properties, internal slots contain a handle to the generated
        private keying materal
        ([[<dfn id="RTCCertificate-handle">handle</dfn>]]) and a certificate
        ([[<dfn id="RTCCertificate-certificate">certificate</dfn>]])
        that <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> uses to authenticate with a
        peer.</p>

        <dl class="idl" title="interface RTCCertificate">
          <dt>readonly attribute Date expires</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>The <var>expires</var> attribute indicates the date and time
            after which the certificate will be considered invalid by the
            browser.  After this time, attempts to construct
            an <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> using this certificate fail.</p>
            <p>Note that this value might not be reflected in
            a <code>notAfter</code> parameter in the certificate itself.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>For the purposes of this API, the
        [[<a href="#RTCCertificate-certificate">certificate</a>]] slot contains
        unstructured binary data.</p>

        <p>Note that a <code>RTCCertificate</code> might not directly hold
        private keying material, this might be stored in a secure module.</p>

        <p>The <code>RTCCertificate</code> object can be stored and retrieved
        from persistent storage by an application.  When a <a>user agent</a> is
        required to obtain a structured clone [[!HTML]] of
        a <code>RTCCertificate</code> object, it performs the following
        steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Let <var>input</var> and <var>memory</var> be the corresponding
          inputs defined by the internal structured cloning algorithm,
          where <var>input</var> represents a <code>RTCCertificate</code> object
          to be cloned.</li>

          <li>Let <var>output</var> be a newly
          constructed <code>RTCCertificate</code> object.</li>

          <li>Copy the value of the <code>expires</code> attribute
          from <var>input</var> to <var>output</var>.</li>

          <li>Let the [[<a href="#RTCCertificate-certificate">certificate</a>]]
          internal slot of <var>output</var> be set to the result of invoking

      <h3>RTCDataChannel</h3>

      <p>The <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> interface represents a
      bi-directional data channel between two peers. A
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> is created via a factory method on an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object. The messages sent between
      the browsers are described in [[!RTCWEB-DATA]] and
      [[!RTCWEB-DATA-PROTOCOL]].</p>

      <p>There are two ways to establish a connection with
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>. The first way is to simply create a
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> at one of the peers with the
      <code><a href="#widl-RTCDataChannelInit-negotiated">negotiated</a></code>
      <code><a>RTCDataChannelInit</a></code> dictionary member unset or set to
      its default value false. This will announce the new channel in-band and
      trigger a <code><a>RTCDataChannelEvent</a></code> with the corresponding
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object at the other peer. The second
      way is to let the application negotiate the
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>. To do this, create a
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object with the <code><a href=
      "#widl-RTCDataChannelInit-negotiated">negotiated</a></code>
      <code><a>RTCDataChannelInit</a></code> dictionary member set to true, and
      signal out-of-band (e.g. via a web server) to the other side that it
      should create a corresponding <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> with the
      <code><a href="#widl-RTCDataChannelInit-negotiated">negotiated</a></code>
      <code><a>RTCDataChannelInit</a></code> dictionary member set to true and
      the same <code><a href="#dom-datachannel-id">id</a></code>. This will
      connect the two separately created <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>
      objects. The second way makes it possible to create channels with
      asymmetric properties and to create channels in a declarative way by
      specifying matching <code><a href=
      "#widl-RTCDataChannelInit-id">ids</a></code>.</p>

      <p>Each <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> has an associated
      <dfn>underlying data transport</dfn> that is used to transport actual
      data to the other peer. The transport properties of the <a>underlying
      data transport</a>, such as in order delivery settings and reliability
      mode, are configured by the peer as the channel is created. The
      properties of a channel cannot change after the channel has been created.
      The actual wire protocol between the peers is specified by the WebRTC
      DataChannel Protocol specification [[RTCWEB-DATA]].</p>

      <p>A <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> can be configured to operate in
      different reliability modes. A reliable channel ensures that the data is
      delivered at the other peer through retransmissions. An unreliable
      channel is configured to either limit the number of retransmissions (
      <code><a href=
      "#widl-RTCDataChannelInit-maxRetransmits">maxRetransmits</a></code> ) or
      set a time during which transmissions (including retransmissions) are
      allowed ( <code><a href=
      "#widl-RTCDataChannelInit-maxPacketLifeTime">maxPacketLifeTime</a></code>
      ). These properties can not be used simultaneously and an attempt to do
      so will result in an error. Not setting any of these properties results
      in a reliable channel.</p>

      <p>A <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>, created with <code><a href=
      "#dom-peerconnection-createdatachannel">createDataChannel()</a></code> or
      dispatched via a <code><a>RTCDataChannelEvent</a></code>, MUST initially
      be in the <code>connecting</code> state. When the
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object's <a>underlying data
      transport</a> is ready, the user agent MUST <a href=
      "#announce-datachannel-open">announce the <code>RTCDataChannel</code> as
      open</a>.</p>

      <p>When the user agent is to <dfn id="announce-datachannel-open">announce
      a <code>RTCDataChannel</code> as open</dfn>, the user agent MUST queue a
      task to run the following steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>If the associated <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object's
          <a href=
          "#dom-peerconnection-signaling-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
          signalingState</a> is <code>closed</code>, abort these steps.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Let <var>channel</var> be the <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>
          object to be announced.</p>

      </ol>

      <p>When an <a>underlying data transport</a> is to be announced (the other
      peer created a channel with <code><a href=
      "#widl-RTCDataChannelInit-negotiated">negotiated</a></code> unset or set
      to false), the user agent of the peer that did not initiate the creation
      process MUST queue a task to run the following steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>If the associated <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object's

          Protocol specification.</p>

          <p>The <dfn>dtmf</dfn> attribute returns a RTCDTMFSender

      <h4>RTCDTMFSender</h4>

      <dl class="idl" title="[NoInterfaceObject] interface RTCDTMFSender">

        optional long interToneGap = 70)</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>An <code><a>RTCDTMFSender</a></code> object's <dfn id=
          "dom-RTCDTMFSender-insertDTMF"><code>insertDTMF()</code></dfn> method
          is used to send DTMF tones.</p>

          <p>The tones parameter is treated as a series of characters. The
          characters 0 through 9, A through D, #, and * generate the associated
          DTMF tones. The characters a to d are equivalent to A to D. The
          character ',' indicates a delay of 2 seconds before processing the
          next character in the tones parameter. All other characters MUST be
          considered <dfn id="dtmf-unrecognized">unrecognized</dfn>.</p>

          <p>The duration parameter indicates the duration in ms to use for
          each character passed in the tones parameters. The duration cannot be
          more than 6000 ms or less than 40 ms. The default duration is 100 ms
          for each tone.</p>

          <p>The interToneGap parameter indicates the gap between tones. It
          MUST be at least 30 ms. The default value is 70 ms.</p>

          <p>The browser MAY increase the duration and interToneGap times to
          cause the times that DTMF start and stop to align with the boundaries
          of RTP packets but it MUST not increase either of them by more than
          the duration of a single RTP audio packet.</p>

    <h2 id="sec.stats-model">Statistics Model</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>The basic statistics model is that the browser maintains a set of
      statistics referenced by a <dfn id="stats-selector">selector</dfn>. The
      selector may, for example, be a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>. For a
      track to be a valid selector, it must be a member of a
      <code>MediaStream</code> that is sent or received by the
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object on which the stats request
      was issued. The calling Web application provides the selector to the
      <code><a href="#widl-RTCPeerConnection-getStats-Promise-RTCStatsReport--MediaStreamTrack-selector">
        getStats()</a></code> method
      and the browser emits (in the JavaScript) a set of statistics that it
      believes is relevant to the selector.</p>

      <div class="issue">
        Evaluate the need for other selectors than MediaStreamTrack.
      </div>

      <p>The statistics returned are designed in such a way that repeated
      queries can be linked by the <code><a>RTCStats</a></code> <a href=
      "#dom-rtcstats-id">id</a> dictionary member. Thus, a Web application can
      make measurements over a given time period by requesting measurements at
      the beginning and end of that period.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>RTCPeerConnection Interface Extensions</h3>

      <p>The Statistics API extends the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>
      interface as described below.</p>

      <dl class="idl" title="partial interface RTCPeerConnection">
        <dt>Promise&lt;RTCStatsReport&gt; getStats(

          and reports the result asynchronously.</p>

          <p>When the <dfn id=
          "#widl-RTCPeerConnection-getStats-Promise-RTCStatsReport--MediaStreamTrack-selector">
            <code>getStats()</code></dfn> method is
          invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Let <var>p</var> be a new promise.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Run the following steps in parallel:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>If <var>selectorArg</var> is an invalid <a href=
                  "#stats-selector">selector</a>, reject <var>p</var> with a

                <li>

                <li>

      <p>The <code><a href="#widl-RTCPeerConnection-getStats-Promise-RTCStatsReport--MediaStreamTrack-selector">
        getStats()</a></code>
      method delivers a successful result in the form of a
      <code><a>RTCStatsReport</a></code> object. A
      <code><a>RTCStatsReport</a></code> object represents a map between
      strings, identifying the inspected objects (<a href=
      "#dom-rtcstats-id">RTCStats.id</a>), and their corresponding
      <code><a>RTCStats</a></code> objects.</p>

      <p>An <code><a>RTCStatsReport</a></code> may be composed of several
      <code><a>RTCStats</a></code> objects, each reporting stats for one
      underlying object that the implementation thinks is relevant for the
      <a href="#stats-selector">selector</a>. One achieves the total for the
      <a href="#stats-selector">selector</a> by summing over all the stats of a
      certain type; for instance, if a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is carried
      by multiple SSRCs over the network, the
      <code><a>RTCStatsReport</a></code> may contain one <code>RTCStats</code>
      object per SSRC (which can be distinguished by the value of the "ssrc"
      stats attribute).</p>

      <h3>RTCStats Dictionary</h3>

      <p>An <code><a>RTCStats</a></code> dictionary represents the stats
      gathered by inspecting a specific object relevant to a <a href=
      "#stats-selector">selector</a>. The <code><a>RTCStats</a></code>
      dictionary is a base type that specifies as set of default attributes,
      such as <a href="#dom-rtcstats-timestamp">timestamp</a> and <a href=
      "#dom-rtcstats-type">type</a>. Specific stats are added by extending the
      <code><a>RTCStats</a></code> dictionary.</p>

      <p>Note that while stats names are standardized, any given implementation
      may be using experimental values or values not yet known to the Web
      application. Thus, applications MUST be prepared to deal with unknown
      stats.</p>

      <div class="issue">
        Need to define an IANA registry for this and populate with
        pointers to existing things such as the RTCP statistics.
      </div>

      <p>Statistics need to be synchronized with each other in order to yield
      reasonable values in computation; for instance, if "bytesSent" and
      "packetsSent" are both reported, they both need to be reported over the
      same interval, so that "average packet size" can be computed as "bytes /
      packets" - if the intervals are different, this will yield errors. Thus
      implementations MUST return synchronized values for all stats in a
      <code><a>RTCStats</a></code> object.</p>

      <h3>Example</h3>

      <p>Consider the case where the user is experiencing bad sound and the
      application wants to determine if the cause of it is packet loss. The
      following example code might be used:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
var baselineReport, currentReport;
var selector = pc.getSenders()[0].track;

pc.getStats(selector).then(function (report) {
    baselineReport = report;

        setTimeout(resolve, aBit); // ... wait a bit
    });
})
.then(function() {
    return pc.getStats(selector);
})
.then(function (report) {
    currentReport = report;
    processStats();
})
.catch(function (error) {
  log(error.toString());
});

function processStats() {
    // compare the elements from the current report with the baseline
    for (var i in currentReport) {
        var now = currentReport[i];
        if (now.type != "outboundrtp")
            continue;

        // get the corresponding stats from the baseline report
        base = baselineReport[now.id];

        if (base) {
            remoteNow = currentReport[now.remoteId];
            remoteBase = baselineReport[base.remoteId];

            var packetsSent = now.packetsSent - base.packetsSent;
            var packetsReceived = remoteNow.packetsReceived - remoteBase.packetsReceived;

            // if fractionLost is &gt; 0.3, we have probably found the culprit
            var fractionLost = (packetsSent - packetsReceived) / packetsSent;
        }
    }

      <h3>Identity Provider Interaction</h3>

      <p>WebRTC offers and answers (and hence the channels established by
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> objects) can be authenticated by
      using a web-based Identity Provider (IdP). The idea is that the entity
      sending an offer or answer acts as the Authenticating Party (AP) and
      obtains an identity assertion from the IdP which it attaches to the
      session description. The consumer of the session description (i.e., the
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> on which
      <code>setRemoteDescription()</code> is called) acts as the Relying Party
      (RP) and verifies the assertion.</p>

      <p>The interaction with the IdP is designed to decouple the browser from
      any particular identity provider; the browser need only know how to load
      the IdP's JavaScript, the location of which is determined by the IdP's
      identity, and the generic interface to generating and validating
      assertions. The IdP provides whatever logic is necessary to bridge the
      generic protocol to the IdP's specific requirements. Thus, a single
      browser can support any number of identity protocols, including being
      forward compatible with IdPs which did not exist at the time the browser
      was written.</p>

      <section>
        <h4 id="sec.identity-proxy-communications">Identity Provider
        Selection</h4>

        <p>An IdP is used to generate an identity assertion as
        follows:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>If the <code>setIdentityProvider()</code> method has been called,
          the IdP provided shall be used.</li>

          <li>If the <code>setIdentityProvider()</code> method has not been
          called, then the user agent MAY use an IdP configured into the
          browser.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In order to verify assertions, the IdP domain name and protocol are
        taken from the <code>domain</code> and <code>protocol</code> fields of
        the identity assertion.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4 id="sec.create-identity-proxy">Instantiating an IdP Proxy</h4>

        <p>In order to communicate with the IdP, the user agent loads the IdP
        JavaScript from the IdP.   The URI for the IdP script is a
        well-known URI formed from the <q>domain</q> and <q>protocol</q>
        fields, as specified in [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].</p>

        <p>The IdP MAY generate an HTTP redirect to another "https" origin, the
        browser MUST treat a redirect to any other scheme as a fatal error.</p>

        <p>The user agent instantiates an isolated interpreted context, a
        JavaScript <a
        href="http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-code-realms"><dfn>realm</dfn></a>
        that operates in the origin of the loaded JavaScript. Note that a
        redirect will change the origin of the loaded script.</p>

        <p>The <a>realm</a> is populated with a global that implements
        <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> [[!WEBWORKERS]].</p>

        <p>The user agent provides an instance of
        <code><a>RTCIdentityProviderRegistrar</a></code> named
        <var>rtcIdentityProvider</var> in the global scope of the <a>realm</a>.
        This object is used by the IdP to interact with the user agent.</p>

        <p>A global property can only be set by the <a>user agent</a>or the IdP
        proxy itself.  Therefore, the IdP proxy can be assured that requests it
        receives originate from the <a>user agent</a>.  This ensures that an
        arbitrary origin is unable to instantiate an IdP proxy and impersonate
        this API in order obtain identity assertions.</p>

      <p>Once instantiated, the IdP script is executed.  The IdP MUST call the
      <code>register()</code> function on the
      <code><var>RTCIdentityProviderRegistrar</a></code> instance during script
      execution.  If an IdP is not registered during this script execution, the

            <p>The <var>origin</var> parameter identifies the origin of the
            <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> that triggered this request.
            An IdP can use this information as input to policy decisions about

      <h3 id="sec.identity-proxy-assertion-request">Requesting Identity
      Assertions</h3>

      <p>The identity assertion request process is triggered by a call to
      <code>createOffer</code>, <code>createAnswer</code>, or
      <code>getIdentityAssertion</code>.  When these calls are invoked and an
      identity provider has been set, the following steps are executed:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instantiates an IdP as described
          in <a href="#sec.identity-proxy-communications"></a> and <a
          href="#sec.register-idp"></a>.  If the IdP cannot be loaded,
          instantiated, or the IdP proxy is not registered, this process
          fails.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> invokes the <code><a
          href="#widl-RTCIdentityProvider-generateAssertion-Promise-RTCIdentityAssertionResult--DOMString-contents-DOMString-origin-DOMString-usernameHint">generateAssertion</a></code>
          method on the <code><a>RTCIdentityProvider</a></code> instance
          registered by the IdP.</p>

          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> generates the
          <var>contents</var> parameter to this method as described in
          [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].  The value of <var>contents</var> includes
          the fingerprint of the certificate that was selected or generated
          during the construction of the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.
          The <var>origin</var> parameter contains the origin of the script that
          calls the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> method that triggers this
          behavior.  The <var>usernameHint</var> value is the same value that is
          provided to
          <code>setIdentityProvider</code>, if any such value was provided.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The IdP returns a Promise to the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.
          If the user has been authenticated by the IdP, and the IdP is willing
          to generate an identity assertion, the IdP resolves the promise with
          an identity assertion in the form of an
          <code><a>RTCIdentityAssertionResult</a></code>.</p>

          <p>This step depends entirely on the IdP. The methods by which an IdP
          authenticates users or generates assertions is not specified, though
          they could involve interacting with the IdP server or other
          servers.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> MAY store the identity assertion
          for use with future offers or answers.  If a fresh identity assertion
          is needed for any reason, applications can create a
          new <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If the identity request was triggered by a
          <code>createOffer()</code> or <code>createAnswer()</code>, then the
          assertion is converted to a JSON string, base64-encoded and inserted
          into an <code>a=identity</code> attribute in the session
          description.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>This process can fail.  The IdP proxy MAY reject the promise, or the
      process of loading and registering the IdP could fail.  If assertion
      generation fails, then the promise for the corresponding function call is
      rejected.</p>

      <p>The browser SHOULD limit the time that it will allow for this process.
      This includes both the loading of the <a href=
      "#sec.identity-proxy-communications">IdP proxy</a> and the identity
      assertion generation. Failure to do so potentially causes the
      corresponding operation to take an indefinite amount of time. This timer
      can be cancelled when the IdP produces a response. The timer running to
      completion can be treated as equivalent to an error from the IdP.</p>

      <section>
        <h4 id="sec.idp-loginneeded">User Login Procedure</h4>

        <p>An IdP MAY reject an attempt to generate an identity assertion if it
        is unable to verify that a user is authenticated. This might be due to
        the IdP not having the necessary authentication information available to
        it (such as cookies).</p>

        <p>Rejecting the promise returned by <code><a
        href="#widl-RTCIdentityProvider-generateAssertion-Promise-RTCIdentityAssertionResult--DOMString-contents-DOMString-origin-DOMString-usernameHint">generateAssertion</a></code>
        will cause the error to propagate to the application.  Login errors are
        indicated by rejecting the promise with an object that has a
        <code>name</code> attribute set to "IdpLoginError".</p>

        <p>If the rejection object also contains a <code>loginUrl</code>
        attribute, this value will be passed to the application in
        the <code>idpLoginUrl</code> attribute. This URL might link to page
        where a user can enter their (IdP) username and password, or otherwise
        provide any information the IdP needs to authorize a assertion
        request.</p>

        <p>An application can load the login URL in an IFRAME or popup window;
        the resulting page then SHOULD provide the user with an opportunity to
        enter any information necessary to complete the authorization process.</p>

        <p>Once the authorization process is complete, the page loaded in the
        IFRAME or popup sends a message using <var>postMessage</var>
        [[!webmessaging]] to the page that loaded it (through the <var><a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/browsers.html#dom-opener">
        window.opener</a></var> attribute for popups, or through <var><a href=
        "http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/browsers.html#dom-parent">
        window.parent</a></var> for pages loaded in an IFRAME). The message MUST
        consist of the <var>DOMString</var> "LOGINDONE". This message informs
        the application that another attempt at generating an identity assertion
        is likely to be successful.</p>

      <h3 id="sec.identity-verify-assertion">Verifying Identity Assertions</h3>

      <p>Identity assertion validation happens when <code><a href=
      "#dom-peerconnection-setremotedescription">setRemoteDescription</a></code>
      is invoked on <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>. The process runs
      asynchronously, meaning that validation of an identity assertion might not
      block the completion of <code>setRemoteDescription</code>.</p>

      <p>The identity assertion request process involves the following
      asynchronous steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> awaits any prior identity
          validation.  Only one identity validation can run at a time for an
          <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.  This can happen because the
          resolution of <code>setRemoteDescription</code> is not blocked by
          identity validation unless there is
          a <a href="#target-peer-identity">target peer identity</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> loads the identity assertion
          from the session description and decodes the base64 value, then parses
          the resulting JSON.  The <var>idp</var> parameter of the resulting
          dictionary contains a <var>domain</var> and an optional
          <var>protocol</var> value that identifies the IdP, as described in
          [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instantiates the identified IdP
          as described in <a href="#sec.identity-proxy-communications"></a> and
          <a href="#sec.register-idp"></a>.  If the IdP cannot be loaded,
          instantiated or the IdP proxy is not registered, this process
          fails.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> invokes the <code><a
          href="#widl-RTCIdentityProvider-validateAssertion-Promise-RTCIdentityValidationResult--DOMString-assertion-DOMString-origin">validateAssertion</a></code>
          method on the <code><a>RTCIdentityProvider</a></code> instance
          registered by the IdP.</p>

          <p>The <var>assertion</var> parameter is taken from the decoded
          identity assertion.  The <var>origin</var> parameter contains the
          origin of the script that calls the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
          method that triggers this behavior.

        <li>
          <p>The IdP proxy returns a promise and performs the validation process
          asynchronously.</p>
          <p>The IdP proxy verifies the identity assertion using whatever means
          necessary.  Depending on the authentication protocol this could
          involve interacting with the IDP server.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Once the assertion is successfully verified, the IdP proxy resolves
          the promise with an <code><a>RTCIdentityValidationResult</a></code>
          containing the validated identity and the original contents that are
          the payload of the assertion.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> decodes the contents and
          validates that it contains a fingerprint value for every
          <code>a=fingerprint</code> attribute in the session description.  This
          ensures that the certificate used by the remote peer for
          communications is covered by the identity assertion.</p>

          <p>If a peer offers a certificate that doesn't match
          an <code>a=fingerprint</code> line in the negotiated session
          description, the <a>user agent</a> MUST NOT permit communication with
          that peer.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> validates that the domain
          portion of the identity matches the domain of the IdP as described in
          [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> resolves the <code><a href=
          "#widl-RTCPeerConnection-peerIdentity">peerIdentity</a></code>
          attribute with a new instance of <code>RTCIdentityAssertion</code>
          that includes the IdP domain and peer identity.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The browser MAY display identity information to a user in browser
          UI. Any user identity information that is displayed in this fashion
          MUST use a mechanism that cannot be spoofed by content.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>This process can fail at any step above.  If identity validation fails,
      the <code><a href=
      "#widl-RTCPeerConnection-peerIdentity">peerIdentity</a></code> promise is
      rejected with a <code>DOMError</code> that has a name of
      <code>IdpError</code>.</p>

      <p>If identity validation fails and there is
      a <a href="#target-peer-identity">target peer identity</a> for the
      <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, the promise returned by
      <code>setRemoteDescription</code> MUST be rejected.</p>

      <p>If identity validation fails and there is no a <a
      href="#target-peer-identity">target peer identity</a>, the value of the
      <code><a href=
      "#widl-RTCPeerConnection-peerIdentity">peerIdentity</a></code> MUST be set
      to a new, unresolved promise instance.  This permits the use of
      renegotiation (or a subsequent answer, if the session description was a
      provisional answer) to resolve or reject the identity.</p>

      <p>The browser SHOULD limit the time that it will allow for identity
      validation.  This includes both the loading of the <a href=
      "#sec.identity-proxy-communications">IdP proxy</a> and the identity
      assertion validation. Failure to do so potentially causes the operation to
      take an indefinite amount of time. This timer can be cancelled when the
      IdP produces a response. The timer running to completion is treated as
      equivalent to an error from the IdP.</p>

      <h3>RTCPeerConnection Interface Extensions</h3>

      <p>The Identity API extends the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>
      interface as described below.</p>

      <dl class="idl" title="partial interface RTCPeerConnection">
        <dt>void setIdentityProvider(DOMString provider, optional DOMString
        protocol, optional DOMString usernameHint)</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Sets the identity provider to be used for a given
          <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> object. Applications need not make this
          call; if the browser is already configured for an IdP, then that
          configured IdP might be used to get an assertion.</p>

          <p>When the <dfn
          id="dom-peerconnection-setidentityprovider"><code>setIdentityProvider()</code></dfn>
          method is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>If the <var>connection</var>'s <a href=
              "#dom-peerconnection-signaling-state"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
              signalingState</a> is <code>closed</code>, throw an
              <code>InvalidStateError</code> exception and abort these
              steps.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Set the current identity provider values to the triplet
              (<code>provider</code>, <code>protocol</code>,
              <code>usernameHint</code>).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>If any identity provider value has changed, discard any stored
              identity assertion.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>Identity provider information is not used until an identity
          assertion is required, either in response to a call to
          <code>getIdentityAssertion</code>, or a session description is
          requested with a call to either <code>createOffer</code> or
          <code>createAnswer</code>.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Promise&lt;DOMString&gt; getIdentityAssertion()</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Initiates the process of obtaining an identity assertion.
          Applications need not make this call. It is merely intended to allow
          them to start the process of obtaining identity assertions before a
          call is initiated. If an identity is needed, either because the
          browser has been configured with a default identity provider or
          because the <code>setIdentityProvider()</code> method was called,
          then an identity will be automatically requested when an offer or
          answer is created.</p>

          <p>When <code>getIdentityAssertion</code> is invoked, queue a task to
          run the following steps:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>If the <var>connection</var>'s <a href=

          <p>A promise that resolves with the identity of the peer if the

          <p>This promise is rejected if an identity assertion is present in a

          any reason.  If the promise is rejected, a new unresolved value is

      <h3>Examples</h3>

      <p>The identity system is designed so that applications need not take any
      special action in order for users to generate and verify identity
      assertions; if a user has configured an IdP into their browser, then the
      browser will automatically request/generate assertions and the other side
      will automatically verify them and display the results. However,
      applications may wish to exercise tighter control over the identity
      system as shown by the following examples.</p>

      <div>
        <p>This example shows how to configure the identity provider and

    <h2>Media Stream API Extensions for Network Use</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>The <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> interface, as defined in the
      [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] specification, typically represents a stream of data of
      audio or video. One or more <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s can be
      collected in a <code>MediaStream</code> (strictly speaking, a <code>
      MediaStream</code> as defined in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] may contain
      zero or more <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> objects).

      A  <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> may be extended to
      represent a stream that either comes from or is sent to a remote peer
      (and not just the local camera, for instance). The extensions required to
      enable this capability on the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> object will be
      described in this section. How the media is transmitted to the peer is
      described in [[!RTCWEB-RTP]], [[!RTCWEB-AUDIO]], and
      [[!RTCWEB-TRANSPORT]].</p>

      A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> sent to another peer will appear as one and
      only one <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> to the recipient. A peer is
      defined as a user agent that supports this specification.
      In addition, the sending side application can indicate what <code>
      MediaStream</code> object(s) the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is member
      of. The corresponding <code>MediaStream</code> object(s) on the receiver
      side will be created (if not already present) and populated accordingly.</p>

      <p>As also described earlier in this document, the objects <code>
      RTCRtpSender</code> and <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code> can be used by the
      application to get more fine grained control over the transmission and
      reception of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s.</p>

      <p>Channels are the smallest unit considered in the
      <code>MediaStream</code> specification. Channels are intended to be
      encoded together for transmission as, for instance, an RTP payload type.
      All of the channels that a codec needs to encode jointly MUST be in the
      same <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> and the codecs SHOULD be able to
      encode, or discard, all the channels in the track.</p>

      <p>The concepts of an input and output to a given
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> apply in the case of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>
      objects transmitted over the network as well. A
      <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> created by an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object (as described previously in this
      document) will take as input the data received from a remote peer.
      Similarly, a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> from a local source, for instance a
      camera via [[!GETUSERMEDIA]], will have an output that represents what is
      transmitted to a remote peer if the object is used with an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>

      <p>The concept of duplicating <code>MediaStream</code> and
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> objects as described in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] is
      also applicable here. This feature can be used, for instance, in a
      video-conferencing scenario to display the
      local video from the user's camera and microphone in a local
      monitor, while only transmitting the audio to the remote peer (e.g. in
      response to the user using a "video mute" feature). Combining
      different <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> objects into new <code>MediaStream</code>
      objects is useful in certain situations.</p>

      <p class="note">In this document, we only specify aspects of the
      following objects that are relevant when used along with an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>. Please refer to the original
      definitions of the objects in the [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] document for general
      information on using <code>MediaStream</code> and
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>.</p>

      <h3>MediaStream</h3>

      <section>
        <h4>id</h4>

        <p>The <code><a href=
        "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediastream-id">id</a></code> attribute
        specified in <code>MediaStream</code> returns an id that is unique to
        this stream, so that streams can be recognized at the
        remote end of the <code><a href=
        "#rtcpeerconnection-interface">RTCPeerConnection</a></code> API.</p>

        <p>When a <code><a href="#mediastream">MediaStream</a></code> is
        created to represent a stream obtained from a remote peer, the
        <code><a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediastream-id">id</a></code>
        attribute is initialized from information provided by the remote
        source.</p>

        <p class="note">The id of a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object is
        unique to the source of the stream, but that does not mean it is not
        possible to end up with duplicates. For example, a locally generated
        stream could be sent from one user agent to a remote peer using
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> and then sent back to the
        original user agent in the same manner, in which case the original user
        agent will have multiple streams with the same id (the
        locally-generated one and the one received from the remote peer).</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Events on MediaStream</h4>

        <p>A new media track may be associated with an existing
        <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>. For example, if a remote peer adds a
        new <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object to a
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>, and indicates that the
        <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> is a member of a <code><a>
        MediaStream</a></code> that has already been created locally
        by the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>, this is observed on the local
        user agent. If this happens for the reason exemplified, or for any
        other reason than the <code><a href=
        "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediastream-addtrack">addTrack()</a></code>
        method being invoked locally on a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> or
        tracks being added as the stream is created (i.e. the stream is
        initialized with tracks),
        the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Let <var>stream</var> be the target
            <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let <var>track</var> be the <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>
            object representing the media component about to be added.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Add <var>track</var> to <var>stream's</var> track set.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fire a track event named <code><a href=
            "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastream-addtrack">addtrack</a></code>
            with the newly created <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object
            at <var>stream</var>.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>An existing media track may also be disassociated from a
        <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>. If this happens for any other reason
        than the <code><a href=
        "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediastream-removetrack">removeTrack()</a></code>
        method being invoked locally on a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> or
        the stream being destroyed, the user agent MUST run the following
        steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Let <var>stream</var> be the target
            <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let <var>track</var> be the <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>
            object representing the media component about to be removed.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Remove <var>track</var> from <var>stream's</var> <a href=
            "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#track-set">track set</a>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Fire a track event named <code><a href=
            "https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#event-mediastream-removetrack">removetrack</a></code>
            with <var>track</var> at <var>stream</var>.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The event source for the <code>onended</code> event in the networked
        case is the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>

      <h3>MediaStreamTrack</h3>

      <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> object's reference to its
      <code>MediaStream</code> in the non-local media source case (an RTP
      source, as is the case for a <code>MediaStream</code> received over an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> ) is always strong.</p>

      <p>When an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> receives data on an RTP
      source for the first time, it MUST <a href="#update-track-muted">update
      the muted state</a> of the corresponding <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
      </code> with the value <code>false</code>.</p>

      <p>When an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>'s RTP source is
      temporarily unable to receive media due to a loss of connection or if a
      mute signal has been received, it MUST <a href=
      "#update-track-muted">update the muted state</a> of the corresponding
      <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> with the value <code>true</code>.
      When media data is available again, the <a href=
      "#update-track-muted">muted state MUST be updated</a> with the value
      <code>false</code>.</p>

      <p class="issue">The mute signal mentioned in the previous paragraph
      is yet to be defined.</p>

      <p>The procedure <dfn id="update-track-muted">update a track's muted
      state</dfn> is specified in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].</p>

      <p>When a track comes
      from a remote peer and the remote peer has permanently stopped sending
      data the <code>ended</code> event MUST be fired on the track, as
      specified in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].</p>

      <p class="issue">How do you know when it has stopped? This seems
      like an SDP question, not a media-level question. (Suggestion: when the
      track is ended, either through port 0, or removing the a=msid attrib)</p>

      <h3>Isolated Media Streams</h3>

      <p>A MediaStream acquired using <code>getUserMedia()</code> is, by
      default, accessible to an application. This means that the application is
      able to access the contents of tracks, modify their content, and send
      that media to any peer it chooses.</p>

      <p>WebRTC supports calling scenarios where media is sent to a
      specifically identified peer, without the contents of media streams being
      accessible to applications. This is enabled by use of the
      <code>peerIdentity</code> parameter to
      <code>getUserMedia()</code>.</p>

      <p>An application willingly relinquishes access to media by including a
      <code>peerIdentity</code> parameter in the
      <code>MediaStreamConstraints</code>. This attribute is set to a
      <code>DOMString</code> containing the identity of a specific peer.</p>

      <p>The <code><dfn>MediaStreamConstraints</dfn></code> dictionary is
      expanded to include the <code>peerIdentity</code> parameter.</p>

      <dl class="idl" title="partial dictionary MediaStreamConstraints">
        <dt>DOMString peerIdentity</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If set, <code>peerIdentity</code> isolates media from the
          application. Media can only be sent to the identified peer.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>A user that is prompted to provide consent for access to a camera or
      microphone can be shown the value of the <code>peerIdentity</code>
      parameter, so that they can be informed that the consent is more narrowly
      restricted.</p>

      <p>When the <code><dfn>peerIdentity</dfn></code> option is supplied to
      <code>getUserMedia()</code>, all of the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s in
      the resulting <code>MediaStream</code> are isolated so that content is

          <p>Displayed in an appropriate media tag (e.g., a video or audio
          element). The browser MUST ensure that content is inaccessible to the
          application by ensuring that the resulting content is given the same
          protections as content that is <a href=

      of isolation restrictions. A <code>MediaStream</code> containing

      can be displayed, but cannot be sent using

        <h4>Isolated Streams and RTCPeerConnection</h4>

        <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> with a <var>peerIdentity</var>
        option set can be added to any <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>.
        However, the content of an isolated track MUST NOT be transmitted
        unless all of the following constraints are met:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> from a stream acquired using the
            <var>peerIdentity</var> option can be transmitted if the
            <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> has successfully <a href=
            "#sec.identity-verify-assertion">validated the identity</a> of the
            peer AND that identity is the same identity that was used in the
            <var>peerIdentity</var> option associated with the track. That is,
            the <code>name</code> attribute of the <code>peerIdentity</code>
            attribute of the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> instance
            MUST match the value of the <code>peerIdentity</code> option passed
            to <code>getUserMedia()</code>.</p>

            <p>Rules for matching identity are described in
            [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The peer has indicated that it will respect the isolation
            properties of streams. That is, a DTLS connection with a promise to
            respect stream confidentiality, as defined in [[!RTCWEB-ALPN]] has
            been established.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Failing to meet these conditions means that no media can be sent for
        the affected <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>. Video MUST be replaced by
        black frames, audio MUST be replaced by silence, and equivalently
        information-free content MUST be provided for other media types.</p>

        <p>Remotely sourced <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s MUST be isolated if
        they are received over a DTLS connection that has been negotiated with
        track isolation. This protects isolated media from the application in
        the receiving browser. These tracks MUST only be displayed to a user
        using the appropriate media element (e.g., &lt;video&gt; or
        &lt;audio&gt;).</p>

        <p>Any <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> that has the
        <var>peerIdentity</var> option set causes all tracks sent using the
        same <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> to be isolated at the
        receiving peer. All DTLS connections created for a
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> with isolated local streams MUST
        be negotiated so that media remains isolated at the remote peer. This
        causes non-isolated media to become isolated at the receiving peer if
        any isolated tracks are added to the same
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>.</p>

        <p class="note">Tracks that are not bound to a particular
        <var>peerIdentity</var> do not cause other streams to be isolated,
        these tracks simply do not have their content transmitted.</p>

        <p>If a stream becomes isolated after initially being accessible, or an
        isolated stream is added to an active session, then media for that
        stream is replaced by information-free content (e.g., black frames or
        silence).</p>
      </section>

      <section id="isolation-protection">
        <h4>Protection Afforded by Media Isolation</h4>

        <p>Media isolation ensures that the content of a
        <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is not accessible to web applications.
        However, to ensure that media with a <var>peerIdentity</var> option set
        can be sent to peers, some meta-information about the media will be
        exposed to applications.</p>

        <p>Applications will be able to observe the parameters of the media
        that affect session negotiation and conversion into RTP. This includes
        the codecs that might be supported by the track, the bitrate, the
        number of packets, and the current settings that are set on the
        <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>.</p>

        <p>In particular, the <a href="#statistics-model">statistics</a> that
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> records are not reduced in
        capability. New statistics that might compromise isolation MUST be
        avoided, or explicitly suppressed for isolated streams.</p>

        <p>Most of these data are exposed to the network when the media is
        transmitted. Only the settings for the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>
        present a new source of information. This can includes the frame rate
        and resolution of video tracks, the bandwidth of audio tracks, and
        other information about the source, which would not otherwise be
        revealed to a network observer. Since settings don't change at a high
        frequency or in response to changes in media content, settings only
        reveal limited reveal information about the content of a track.
        However, any setting that might change dynamically in response to the
        content of an isolated <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> MUST have changes
        suppressed.</p>

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
    <p>This section is non-normative; it specifies no new behaviour,
    but instead summarizes information already present in other parts
    of the specification.</p>

    <p>This document extends the Web platform with the ability to set
    up real time, direct communication between browsers and other
    devices, including other browsers.</p>

    <p>This means that data and media can be shared between
    applications running in different browsers, or between an
    application running in the same browser and something that is not a
    browser, something that is an extension to the usual barriers in
    the Web model against sending data between entities with different
    origins.</p>

    <p>The WebRTC specification provides no user prompts or chrome
    indicators for communication; it assumes that once the Web page
    has been allowed to access media, it is free to share that media
    with other entities as it chooses.</p>

    <p>A mechanism, <code><a>peerIdentity</a></code>, is provided that gives
    Javascript the option of requesting media that the same javascript
    cannot access, but can only be sent to certain other entities.</p>

    <p>Even without WebRTC, the Web server providing a Web application
    will know the public IP
    address to which the application is delivered. Setting up
    communications exposes additional information about the browser’s
    network context to the web application, and may include the set of
    (possibly private) IP addresses available to the browser for WebRTC
    use. Some of this information has to be passed to the
    corresponding party to enable the establishment of a communication
    session.</p>

    <p>Revealing IP addresses can leak location and means of
    connection; this can be sensitive.</p>

    <p>A connection will always reveal the IP addresses proposed for
    communication to the corresponding party. The application can limit
    this exposure by choosing not to use certain addresses using the
    <a>RTCIceTransportPolicy</a>, and by
    using relays (for instance TURN servers) rather than direct
    connections between participants. One will normally assume that
    the IP address of TURN servers is not sensitive information.</p>

    <p>Mitigating the exposure of IP addresses to the application requires
    limiting the IP addresses that can be used, which will impact the
    ability to communicate on the most direct path between endpoints.
    Browsers are encouraged to provide appropriate controls for deciding
    which IP addresses are made available to applications, based on the
    security posture desired by the user.</p>

    <div class="issue" data-number="179">
      <p>The working group is actively discussing what additional text
      regarding exposure of IP addresses is appropriate for this section.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>Since the browser is an active platform executing in a trusted
    network environment (inside the firewall), it is important to
    limit the damage that the browser can do to other elements on the
    local network, and it is important to protect data from
    interception, manipulation and modification by untrusted
    participants.</p>

    <p>Mitigations include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An UA will always request permission from the correspondent
      UA to communicate using ICE. This
      ensures that the UA can only send to partners who you have
      shared credentials with.</li>
      <li>An UA will always request ongoing permission to continue sending
      using ICE continued
      consent. This enables a receiver to withdraw consent to
      receive.</li>
      <li>An UA will always encrypt data, with strong per-session keying
      (DTLS-SRTP).</li>
      <li>An UA wil always use congestion control. This ensures that
      WebRTC cannot be used to flood the network.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These measures are specified in the relevant IETF documents.</p>


    <p>The fact that communication is taking place cannot be hidden from
    adversaries that can observe the network, so this has to be
    regarded as public information.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-iana">IANA Registrations</h2>



    <p>IANA is requested to register the constraints defined in <a href=

      <p>TOOD: Need to change the naming and declaration of these constraints
      to match the constraints draft once that is a bit further along. The

      holder.</p>


      <p class="issue">ISSUE: there are multiple ways to add constraints. How
