    <p>This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to allow media
    to be sent to and received from another browser or device implementing the
    appropriate set of real-time protocols. This specification is being
    developed in conjunction with a protocol specification developed by the
    IETF RTCWEB group and an API specification to get access to local media
    devices developed by the Media Capture Task Force.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="sotd">
    <p>The API is based on preliminary work done in the WHATWG.</p>

    <p>While the specification is feature complete and is expected to be stable, there are also a number of <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20-label%3AEditorial%20">known substantive issues</a> on the specification that will be addressed during the Candidate Recommendation period based on implementation experience feedback.</p>

    <p>It might also evolve based on feedback gathered as its <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/webrtc">associated test suite</a> evolves. This test suite will be used to build an <a href="https://wpt.fyi/webrtc">implementation report</a> of the API.</p>

    <p>To go into Proposed Recommendation status, the group expects to demonstrate implementation of each feature in at least two deployed browsers, and at least one implementation of each optional feature. Mandatory feature with only one implementation may be marked as optional in a revised Candidate Recommendation where applicable.</p>

    <p>The following features are marked as at risk:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The value <a href="#dom-rtcrtcpmuxpolicy-negotiate"><code>negotiate</code></a> of RTCRtcpMuxPolicy</li>
      <li>The <code>encodings</code> attribute of <code><a>RTCRtpReceiveParameters</a></code></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>There are a number of facets to peer-to-peer communications and
    video-conferencing in HTML covered by this specification:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Connecting to remote peers using NAT-traversal technologies such as
      ICE, STUN, and TURN.</li>
      <li>Sending the locally-produced tracks to remote peers and receiving
      tracks from remote peers.</li>
      <li>Sending arbitrary data directly to remote peers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This document defines the APIs used for these features. This
    specification is being developed in conjunction with a protocol
    specification developed by the <a href=
    "https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rtcweb/">IETF RTCWEB group</a> and an API
    specification to get access to local media devices [[!GETUSERMEDIA]]
    developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Media_Capture">Media
    Capture Task Force</a>. An overview of the system can be found in
    [[RTCWEB-OVERVIEW]] and [[RTCWEB-SECURITY]].</p>

  <section id="conformance">
    <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
    product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it
    contains.</p>
    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
    implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
    particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
    easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>
    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
    this specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the
    ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL-1]], as
    this specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>An <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> instance allows an
      application to establish peer-to-peer communications with another
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> instance in another browser, or to
      another endpoint implementing the required protocols. Communications are coordinated by the
      exchange of control messages (called a signaling protocol) over a
      signaling channel which is provided by unspecified means, but generally
      by a script in the page via the server, e.g. using
      <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> [[XMLHttpRequest]] or Web Sockets
      [[WEBSOCKETS-API]].</p>

                <p>For OAuth Authentication, the <a>ICE Agent</a> requires three
                pieces of credential information. The credential is composed of
                a <code>kid</code>, which the <a>RTCIceServer</a>

                Token type, as described in [[!RFC6749]] and

                Authenticated encryption is used for message encryption and

      <h3>RTCPeerConnection Interface</h3>
      <p>The [[!JSEP]] specification, as a whole, describes the details of how
      the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> operates. References to
      specific subsections of [[!JSEP]] are provided as appropriate.</p>
      <section>
        <h4>Operation</h4>
        <p>Calling <code>new <a>RTCPeerConnection</a>(<var>configuration</var>)
        </code> creates an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>
        <p><code><var>configuration</var>.servers</code> contains information
        used to find and access the servers used by ICE. The application can
        supply multiple servers of each type, and any TURN server MAY also be
        used as a STUN server for the purposes of gathering server reflexive
        candidates.</p>
        <p>An <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object has a <dfn>signaling
        state</dfn>, a <dfn>connection state</dfn>, an <dfn>ICE gathering
        state</dfn>, and an <dfn>ICE connection state</dfn>. These are
        initialized when the object is created.</p>

        <p data-link-for="RTCPeerConnection">The ICE protocol implementation of
        an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> is represented by an <dfn>ICE
        agent</dfn> [[!ICE]]. Certain <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>
        methods involve interactions with the <a>ICE Agent</a>, namely
        <code><a>addIceCandidate</a></code>, <code><a>setConfiguration</a></code>,
        <code><a>setLocalDescription</a></code>,
        <code><a>setRemoteDescription</a></code> and <code><a>close</a></code>.
        These interactions are described in the relevant sections in this
        document and in [[!JSEP]]. The <a>ICE Agent</a> also provides
        indications to the user agent when the state of its internal
        representation of an <code><a>RTCIceTransport</a></code> changes, as
        described in <a href= "#rtcicetransport"></a>.</p>

        <a>networking task source</a>.</p>

        <h4>Constructor</h4>
        <p>When the <dfn id=
        "dom-peerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection()</code></dfn> constructor
        is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>If any of the steps enumerated below fails for a reason not
              specified here, <a>throw</a> an <code>UnknownError</code>
              with the "message" field set to an appropriate description.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Let <var>connection</var> be a newly created
            <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If the <code>certificates</code> value in
            <var>configuration</var> is non-empty, check that
            the <code>expires</code> on each value is in the future. If a
            certificate has expired or a the [[\Origin]] internal slot of
            the certificate does not match the current origin, <a>throw</a> an
            <code>InvalidAccessError</code>; otherwise, store the certificates.
            If no <code>certificates</code> value was specified, one or more
            new <code>RTCCertificate</code> instances are generated for use
            with this <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instance. This MAY happen
            asynchronously and the value of <code>certificates</code> remains
            undefined for the subsequent steps.</p>

        <p>An <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object has an
        <dfn>operations queue</dfn>, <a>[[\Operations]]</a>, which ensures that
        only one asynchronous operation in the queue is executed concurrently.
        If subsequent calls are made while the returned promise of a previous
        call is still not <a>settled</a>, they are added to the queue and executed
        when all the previous calls have finished executing and their promises
        have <a>settled</a>.</p>
        <p>To <dfn>enqueue an operation</dfn> to an
        <a><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a> object's operation queue, run
        the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Let <var>connection</var> be the

          <li>
            <p>If <var>connection</var>'s <a>[[\IsClosed]]</a> slot is
            <code>true</code>, return a promise <a>rejected</a> with a newly
            <a data-link-for="exception" data-lt="create">created</a>
            <code>InvalidStateError</code>.</p>

                <code>true</code>, abort these steps.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>If the promise returned by <var>operation</var> was
                <a>fulfilled</a> with a value, <a>fulfill</a> <var>p</var> with that
                value.</p>

              <li>
                <p>If the promise returned by <var>operation</var> was <a>rejected</a>
                with a value, <a>reject</a> <var>p</var> with that value.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Upon <a>fulfillment</a> or <a>rejection</a> of <var>p</var>, execute the

            "RTCPeerConnection" class="methods">
              <dt><dfn data-idl><code>createOffer</code></dfn></dt>
              <dd>
                <p>The <code>createOffer</code> method generates a blob of SDP that contains
                an RFC 3264 offer with the supported configurations for the
                session, including descriptions of the local
                <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s attached to this
                <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, the codec/RTP/RTCP capabilities
                supported by this implementation, and parameters of the <a>ICE
                agent</a> and the DTLS connection. The <code>options</code>
                parameter may be supplied to provide additional control over
                the offer generated.</p>
                <p>If a system has limited resources (e.g. a finite number of
                decoders), <code>createOffer</code> needs to return an offer
                that reflects the current state of the system, so that
                <code>setLocalDescription</code> will succeed when it attempts
                to acquire those resources. The session descriptions MUST
                remain usable by <code>setLocalDescription</code> without
                causing an error until at least the end of the <a>fulfillment</a>
                callback of the returned promise.</p>
                <p>Creating the SDP MUST follow the appropriate process for
                generating an offer described in [[!JSEP]].
                As an offer, the generated SDP will contain the full set of
                codec/RTP/RTCP capabilities supported by the session (as
                opposed to an answer, which will include only a specific
                negotiated subset to use). In the event
                <code>createOffer</code> is called after the session is
                established, <code>createOffer</code> will generate an offer
                that is compatible with the current session, incorporating any
                changes that have been made to the session since the last
                complete offer-answer exchange, such as addition or removal of
                tracks. If no changes have been made, the offer will include
                the capabilities of the current local description as well as
                any additional capabilities that could be negotiated in an
                updated offer.</p>
                <p>The generated SDP will also contain the <a>ICE agent</a>'s
                <a data-link-for="RTCIceParameters">usernameFragment</a>,
                <a data-link-for="RTCIceParameters">password</a> and
                ICE options (as defined in [[!ICE]], Section 14) and may also contain
                any local candidates that have been gathered by the agent.</p>
                <p>The <code>certificates</code> value in <var>configuration</var>
                for the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> provides the
                certificates configured by the application for the
                <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.  These certificates,
                along with any default certificates are used to produce a set of
                certificate fingerprints. These certificate fingerprints are
                used in the construction of SDP and as input to requests for
                identity assertions.</p>
                <p>If the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> is configured to
                generate Identity assertions by calling
                <code><a>setIdentityProvider</a></code>, then the session description
                SHALL contain an appropriate assertion.</p>
                <p class="fingerprint">The process of generating an SDP exposes a
                subset of the media capabilities of the underlying system,
                which provides generally persistent cross-origin information on
                the device. It thus increases the fingerprinting surface of the
                application. In privacy-sensitive contexts, browsers can
                consider mitigations such as generating SDP matching only a
                common subset of the capabilities.</p>

                <p>The <code>createAnswer</code> method generates an [[!SDP]]
                answer with the supported configuration for the session that is
                compatible with the parameters in the remote configuration.
                Like <code>createOffer</code>, the returned blob of SDP contains
                descriptions of the local <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s
                attached to this <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, the
                codec/RTP/RTCP options negotiated for this session, and any
                candidates that have been gathered by the <a>ICE Agent</a>. The
                <code>options</code> parameter may be supplied to provide
                additional control over the generated answer.</p>
                <p>Like <code>createOffer</code>, the
                returned description SHOULD reflect the current state of the
                system. The session descriptions MUST remain usable by
                <code>setLocalDescription</code> without causing an error until
                at least the end of the <a>fulfillment</a> callback of the returned
                promise.</p>
                <p>As an answer, the generated SDP will contain a specific
                codec/RTP/RTCP configuration that, along with the corresponding offer,
                specifies how the media plane should be established. The
                generation of the SDP MUST follow the appropriate process for
                generating an answer described in [[!JSEP]].</p>
                <p>The generated SDP will also contain the <a>ICE agent</a>'s
                <a data-link-for="RTCIceParameters">usernameFragment</a>,
                <a data-link-for="RTCIceParameters">password</a> and
                ICE options (as defined in [[!ICE]], Section 14) and may also contain
                any local candidates that have been gathered by the agent.</p>
                <p>The <code>certificates</code> value in <var>configuration</var>
                for the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> provides the
                certificates configured by the application for the
                <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.  These certificates,
                along with any default certificates are used to produce a set of
                certificate fingerprints. These certificate fingerprints are
                used in the construction of SDP and as input to requests for
                identity assertions.</p>
                <p>An answer can be marked as provisional, as described in
                <span data-jsep="use-of-provisional-answer">[[!JSEP]]</span>,
                by setting the <code><a data-link-for=
                "RTCSessionDescription">type</a></code> to
                <code>"pranswer"</code>.</p>
                <p>If the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> is configured to
                generate Identity assertions by calling
                <code><a>setIdentityProvider</a></code>, then the session description SHALL
                contain an appropriate assertion.</p>
                <p>When the method is called, the user agent MUST run the
                following steps:</p>

      <h3>Session Negotiation Model</h3>
      <p>Many changes to state of an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> will
      require communication with the remote side via the signaling channel, in
      order to have the desired effect. The app can be kept informed as to when
      it needs to do signaling, by listening to the
      <code>negotiationneeded</code> event. This event is fired according to
      the state of the connection's <dfn>negotiation-needed flag</dfn>,
      represented by a <a>[[\NegotiationNeeded]]</a> internal slot.</p>
      <section class="informative">
        <h4>Setting Negotiation-Needed</h4>
        <p>If an operation is performed on an
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> that requires signaling, the
        connection will be marked as needing negotiation. Examples of such
        operations include adding or stopping an
        <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>, or adding the first <code><a>
        RTCDataChannel</a></code>.</p>
        <p>Internal changes within the implementation can also result in the
        connection being marked as needing negotiation.</p>
        <p>Note that the exact procedures for <a data-lt="update the
        negotiation-needed flag">updating the negotiation-needed flag</a>
        are specified below.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="informative">
        <h4>Clearing Negotiation-Needed</h4>
        <p>The negotiation-needed flag is cleared when an
        <code><a>RTCSessionDescription</a></code> of type "answer" <a href=
        "#set-description">is applied</a>, and the supplied description matches
        the state of the
        <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>s and
        <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>s that currently exist on the
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>. Specifically, this means that all
        non-<a data-link-for="RTCRtpTransceiver">stopped</a> transceivers have an
        <a>associated</a> section in the local description with matching properties,
        and, if any data channels have been created, a data section exists in

        <h4>Updating the Negotiation-Needed flag</h4>
        <p>The process below occurs where referenced elsewhere in this document.
        It also may occur as a result of internal changes within the
        implementation that affect negotiation. If such changes occur, the user
        agent MUST queue a task to <a>update the negotiation-needed
        flag</a>.</p>
        <p>To <dfn>update the negotiation-needed flag</dfn> for
        <var>connection</var>, run the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>If <var>connection</var>'s <a>[[\IsClosed]]</a> slot is
            <code>true</code>, abort these steps.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If <var>connection</var>'s <a>signaling state</a> is not
            <code>"stable"</code>, abort these steps.<p>

            <p class="note">The negotiation-needed flag will be
            updated once the state transitions to "stable", as part of the steps
            for <a href="#set-description">setting an RTCSessionDescription</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If the result of <a data-lt="check if negotiation is needed">

            <dfn>clear the negotiation-needed flag</dfn> by setting
            <var>connection</var>'s <a>[[\NegotiationNeeded]]</a> slot to
            <code>false</code>, and abort these steps.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If <var>connection</var>'s <a>[[\NegotiationNeeded]]</a> slot is
            already <code>true</code>, abort these steps.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Set <var>connection</var>'s <a>[[\NegotiationNeeded]]</a> slot to
            <code>true</code>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Queue a task that runs the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>If <var>connection</var>'s <a>[[\IsClosed]]</a> slot
                is <code>true</code>, abort these steps.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>If <var>connection</var>'s <a>[[\NegotiationNeeded]]</a>
                slot is <code>false</code>, abort these steps.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Fire a simple event named <a>negotiationneeded</a>
                at <var>connection</var>.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="note">This queueing prevents <a>negotiationneeded</a> from

          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>To <dfn>check if negotiation is needed</dfn> for

              <a>generation</a> of candidates, and is providing an end-of-candidates
              indication as defined by Section 8.2 of [[TRICKLE-ICE]]. This is
              indicated by <code><a data-link-for="RTCPeerConnectionIceEvent">candidate</a>.<a
              data-link-for="RTCIceCandidate">candidate</a></code> being set to an
              empty string. The <code><a
              data-link-for="RTCPeerConnectionIceEvent">candidate</a></code> object
              should be signaled to the remote peer and passed into
              <code><a data-link-for="RTCPeerConnection">addIceCandidate</a></code>
              like a typical ICE candidate, in order to provide the
              end-of-candidates indication to the remote peer.</p>

            <li>
              <p>All <code><a>RTCIceTransport</a></code>s have finished
              gathering candidates, and the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>'s
              <code><a>RTCIceGatheringState</a></code> has transitioned to
              <code>"<a data-link-for="RTCIceGatheringState">complete</a>"</code>.
              This is indicated by the
              <code><a data-link-for="RTCPeerConnectionIceEvent">candidate</a></code>
              member of the event being set to <code>null</code>. This only
              exists for backwards compatibility, and this event does not need
              to be signaled to the remote peer. It's equivalent to an
              <code>"<a>icegatheringstatechange</a>"</code> event with the
              <code>"<a data-link-for="RTCIceGatheringState">complete</a>"</code>

      <h2>Priority and QoS Model</h2>
      <p>Many applications have multiple media flows of the same data type and
      often some of the flows are more important than others. WebRTC uses the
      priority and Quality of Service (QoS) framework described in
      [[!RTCWEB-TRANSPORT]] and [[!TSVWG-RTCWEB-QOS]] to provide priority and
      DSCP marking for packets that will help provide QoS in some networking
      environments. The priority setting can be used to indicate the relative
      priority of various flows. The priority API allows the JavaScript
      applications to tell the browser whether a particular media flow is high,
      medium, low or of very low importance to the application by setting the
      <code>priority</code> property of
      <code><a>RTCRtpEncodingParameters</a></code> objects to one of the
      following values.</p>

              [[!X509V3]] and corresponding private key. A handle to
              information is provided in the form of the
              <code>RTCCertificate</code> interface. The returned
              <code>RTCCertificate</code> can be used to control the
              certificate that is offered in the DTLS sessions established by
              <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.</p>
              <p>The <var>keygenAlgorithm</var> argument is used to control how
              the private key associated with the certificate is generated. The

              [[!WebCryptoAPI]] <a data-cite=

              <code>AlgorithmIdentifier</code>) MUST be an asymmetric algorithm
              that can be used to produce a signature.</p>
              <p>The certificate produced by this process also contains a

              compatibility reasons. Only the public key and the resulting
              certificate fingerprint are used by
              <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, but it is more likely that a
              certificate will be accepted if the certificate is well formed.
              The browser selects the algorithm used to sign the certificate; a
              browser SHOULD select SHA-256 [[!FIPS-180-4]] if a hash algorithm
              is needed.</p>
              <p>The resulting certificate MUST NOT include information that

        <p>For the purposes of this API, the <a>[[\Certificate]]</a> slot
        contains unstructured binary data. No mechanism is provided for
        applications to access the <a>[[\KeyingMaterial]]</a> internal slot.
        Implementations MUST support applications storing and retrieving
        <code>RTCCertificate</code> objects from persistent storage.
        In implementations where an <code>RTCCertificate</code> might not
        directly hold private keying material (it might be stored in a
        secure module), a reference to the private key can be held in

        <p>When a <a>user agent</a> is required to obtain a structured

          be cloned.</li>
          <li>Let <var>output</var> be a newly constructed

          <li>Copy the value of the <code>expires</code> attribute from

          <li>Let the <a>[[\Certificate]]</a> internal slot of <var>output</var>
          be set to the result of invoking the internal structured clone
          algorithm recursively on the corresponding internal slots of

          "<var>memory</var>" argument.
          </li>
          <li>Let the <a>[[\KeyingMaterial]]</a> internal slot of <var>output</var>
          refer to the same private keying material represented by the

        <p class="note">Supporting structured cloning in this manner
        allows <a>RTCCertificate</a> instances to be persisted to stores.  It

    <h2>RTP Media API</h2>
    <p>The <dfn>RTP media API</dfn> lets a web application send and receive
    <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s over a peer-to-peer connection. Tracks, when
    added to an <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, result in signaling; when this
    signaling is forwarded to a remote peer, it causes corresponding tracks to
    be created on the remote side.</p>
    <p>When sending media, the sender may need to rescale or
    resample the media to meet various requirements including the
    envelope negotiated by SDP.</p>
    <p>Following the rules in <span data-jsep="imageattr">[[!JSEP]]</span>, the
    video MAY be downscaled in order to fit the SDP constraints. The media MUST
    NOT be upscaled to create fake data that did not occur in the input source,
    the media MUST NOT be cropped except as needed to satisfy constraints on
    pixel counts, and the aspect ratio MUST NOT be changed.</p>
    <p class="note">The WebRTC Working Group is seeking implementation 
    feedback on the need and timeline for a more complex handling of this 
    situation. Some possible designs have been discussed in <a 
    href="https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/1283">GitHub issue 
    1283</a>.</p>
    <p>When video is rescaled, for example for certain combinations
    of width or height and
    <code><a data-link-for="RTCRtpEncodingParameters">
    scaleResolutionDownBy</a></code> values, situations when the resulting width
    or height is not an integer may occur. In such situations the
    user agent MUST use <a href="https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#eqn-floor">the
    integer part of the result</a>. What to transmit if the integer
    part of the scaled width or height is zero is implementation-specific.</p>
    <p>The actual encoding and transmission of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s
    is managed through objects called <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a></code>s.
    Similarly, the reception and decoding of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s is
    managed through objects called <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a></code>s. Each
    <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a></code> is associated with at most one track,
    and each track to be received is associated with exactly
    one <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a></code>.</p>
    <p>The encoding and transmission of each <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>
    SHOULD be made such that its characteristics (width, height and frameRate
    for video tracks; volume, sampleSize, sampleRate and channelCount for audio
    tracks) are to a reasonable degree retained by the track created on the
    remote side. There are situations when this does not apply, there may for
    example be resource constraints at either endpoint or in the network or
    there may be <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a></code> settings applied that
    instruct the implementation to act differently.</p>
    <p>
      An <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object contains a <dfn id=
      "transceivers-set" data-lt="set of transceivers">set of
      <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>s</dfn>, representing the paired
      senders and receivers with some shared state. This set is initialized to
      the empty set when the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object is
      created. <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a></code>s and
      <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a></code>s are always created at the same time
      as an <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>, which they will remain
      attached to for their lifetime.
      <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>s are created implicitly when the
      application attaches a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> to an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> via the <code>addTrack</code>
      method, or explicitly when the application uses the
      <code>addTransceiver</code> method. They are also created when a remote
      description is applied that includes a new media description.
      Additionally, when a remote description is applied that indicates the
      remote endpoint has media to send, the relevant
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> and <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a></code> are
      surfaced to the application via the <code><a>track</a></code> event.

      <p>The <dfn>RTCRtpContributingSource</dfn> and

      about a given contributing source (CSRC) or synchronization source (SSRC)
      respectively, including the most recent time a
      packet that the source contributed to was played out. The browser MUST
      keep information from RTP packets received in the previous 10 seconds.
      When the first audio frame contained in an RTP packet is delivered to the
      <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a></code>'s <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>
      for playout, the user agent MUST queue a task to update the relevant
      information for the <code><a>RTCRtpContributingSource</a></code> and
      <code><a>RTCRtpSynchronizationSource</a></code> dictionaries based on the
      contents of the packet. The information relevant to the
      <code><a>RTCRtpSynchronizationSource</a></code> dictionary corresponding
      to the SSRC identifier, is updated each time, and if the RTP packet
      contains CSRC identifiers, then the information relevant to the
      <code><a>RTCRtpContributingSource</a></code> dictionaries corresponding to
      those CSRC identifiers is also updated.</p>

              <p>Both RFCs define the level as an integral value from 0 to 127

              <p>This method allows applications to disable the negotiation of

              peer to prefer the codec that appears first in the list for
              sending.</p>
              <p>Codec preferences remain in effect for all calls to
              <code>createOffer</code> and <code>createAnswer</code> that
              include this <code>RTCRtpTransceiver</code> until this method is
              called again. Setting <var>codecs</var> to an empty sequence
              resets codec preferences to any default value.</p>
              <p>The <code>codecs</code> sequence passed into
              <code>setCodecPreferences</code> can only contain codecs that are
              returned by <code>RTCRtpSender.getCapabilities(kind)</code> or
              <code>RTCRtpReceiver.getCapabilities(kind)</code>, where
              <code>kind</code> is the kind of the
              <code>RTCRtpTransceiver</code> on which the method is called.
              Additionally, the <code>RTCRtpCodecCapability</code> dictionary
              members cannot be modified. If <code>codecs</code> does not
              fulfill these requirements, the user agent MUST <a>throw</a> an

              <p class="note">
              Due to a recommendation in [[!SDP]], calls to
              <code>createAnswer</code> SHOULD use only the common subset of
              the codec preferences and the codecs that appear in the offer.
              For example, if codec preferences are "C, B, A", but only codecs
              "A, B" were offered, the answer should only contain codecs "B,
              A". However, <span data-jsep="initial-answers">[[!JSEP]]</span>
              allows adding codecs that were not in the offer, so
              implementations can behave differently.</p>

      <h3><dfn>RTCDtlsTransport</dfn> Interface</h3>
      <p>The <code><a>RTCDtlsTransport</a></code> interface allows an
      application access to information about the Datagram Transport Layer
      Security (DTLS) transport over which RTP and RTCP packets are sent and
      received by <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a></code> and
      <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a></code> objects, as well other data such as
      SCTP packets sent and received by data channels. In particular, DTLS adds
      security to an underlying transport, and the
      <code>RTCDtlsTransport</code> interface allows access to information
      about the underlying transport and the security added.
      <code><a>RTCDtlsTransport</a></code> objects are constructed as a result
      of calls to <code>setLocalDescription()</code> and
      <code>setRemoteDescription()</code>. Each
      <code><a>RTCDtlsTransport</a></code> object represents the DTLS transport
      layer for the RTP or RTCP <code><a data-link-for="RTCIceTransport">component</a></code>
      of a specific <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>, or a group of
      <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>s if such a group has been
      negotiated via [[!BUNDLE]].</p>

      <p>An ICE restart causes candidate gathering and connectity checks to
      begin anew, causing a transition to <code>connected</code> if begun in the
      <code>completed</code> state. If begun in the transient
      <code>disconnected</code> state, it causes a transition to
      <code>checking</code>, effectively forgetting that connectivity was
      previously lost.</p>
      <p>The <code>failed</code> and <code>completed</code> states require an
      indication that there are no additional remote candidates. This can be
      indicated by calling <code><a href=
      "#dom-rtcpeerconnection-addicecandidate">addIceCandidate</a></code> with
      a candidate value whose <code>candidate</code> property is set
      to an empty string or by <a data-link-for=
      "RTCPeerConnection">canTrickleIceCandidates</a> being set to
      <code>false</code>.</p>
      <p>Some example state transitions are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>(<code><a>RTCIceTransport</a></code> first created, as a result of
        <code>setLocalDescription</code> or <code>setRemoteDescription</code>):
        <code>new</code></li>
        <li>(<code>new</code>, remote candidates received):
        <code>checking</code></li>
        <li>(<code>checking</code>, found usable connection):
        <code>connected</code></li>
        <li>(<code>checking</code>, checks fail but gathering still in
        progress): <code>disconnected</code></li>
        <li>(<code>checking</code>, gave up): <code>failed</code></li>
        <li>(<code>disconnected</code>, new local candidates):
        <code>checking</code></li>
        <li>(<code>connected</code>, finished all checks):
        <code>completed</code></li>
        <li>(<code>completed</code>, lost connectivity):
        <code>disconnected</code></li>
        <li>(<code>disconnected</code> or <code>failed</code>, ICE restart occurs):
        <code>checking</code></li>
        <li>(<code>completed</code>, ICE restart occurs):
        <code>connected</code></li>
        <li><code>RTCPeerConnection.close()</code>: <code>closed</code></li>

      <h3><dfn>RTCDataChannel</dfn></h3>
      <p>The <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> interface represents a
      bi-directional data channel between two peers. An
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> is created via a factory method on an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object. The messages sent between
      the browsers are described in [[!RTCWEB-DATA]] and
      [[!RTCWEB-DATA-PROTOCOL]].</p>
      <p>There are two ways to establish a connection with
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>. The first way is to simply create an
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> at one of the peers with the
      <code><a data-link-for="RTCDataChannelInit">negotiated</a></code>
      <code><a>RTCDataChannelInit</a></code> dictionary member unset or set to
      its default value false. This will announce the new channel in-band and
      trigger an <code><a>RTCDataChannelEvent</a></code> with the corresponding
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object at the other peer. The second
      way is to let the application negotiate the
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>. To do this, create an
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object with the <code><a data-link-for=
      "RTCDataChannelInit">negotiated</a></code>
      <code><a>RTCDataChannelInit</a></code> dictionary member set to true, and
      signal out-of-band (e.g. via a web server) to the other side that it
      SHOULD create a corresponding <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> with the
      <code><a data-link-for="RTCDataChannelInit">negotiated</a></code>
      <code><a>RTCDataChannelInit</a></code> dictionary member set to true and
      the same <code><a data-link-for="RTCDataChannel">id</a></code>. This will
      connect the two separately created <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>
      objects. The second way makes it possible to create channels with
      asymmetric properties and to create channels in a declarative way by
      specifying matching <code><a data-link-for=
      "RTCDataChannelInit">id</a></code>s.</p>
      <p>Each <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> has an associated
      <dfn data-lt="data transport">underlying data transport</dfn> that is
      used to transport actual data to the other peer. In the case of SCTP
      data channels utilizing an <code><a>RTCSctpTransport</a></code> (which
      represents the state of the SCTP association), the underlying data
      transport is the SCTP stream pair. The transport properties of
      the <a>underlying data transport</a>, such as in order delivery
      settings and reliability mode, are configured by the peer as the channel
      is created. The properties of a channel cannot change after the channel
      has been created. The actual wire protocol between the peers is specified
      by the WebRTC DataChannel Protocol specification [[RTCWEB-DATA]].</p>
      <p>An <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> can be configured to operate in
      different reliability modes. A reliable channel ensures that the data is
      delivered at the other peer through retransmissions. An unreliable
      channel is configured to either limit the number of retransmissions (
      <code><a data-link-for="RTCDataChannelInit">maxRetransmits</a></code> ) or set
      a time during which transmissions (including retransmissions) are allowed
      ( <code><a data-link-for="RTCDataChannelInit">maxPacketLifeTime</a></code> ).
      These properties can not be used simultaneously and an attempt to do so
      will result in an error. Not setting any of these properties results in a
      reliable channel.</p>
      <p>An <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>, created with <code><a data-link-for=
      "RTCPeerConnection">createDataChannel</a></code> or dispatched via an
      <code><a>RTCDataChannelEvent</a></code>, MUST initially be in the
      <code>connecting</code> state. When the
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object's <a>underlying data
      transport</a> is ready, the user agent MUST <a>announce the
      <code>RTCDataChannel</code> as open</a>.</p>
      <p>To <dfn>create an <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code></dfn>, run the
      following steps:</p>
      <ol>

          object to be announced.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If <var>channel</var>'s <a>[[\ReadyState]]</a> is <code>closing</code> or

              attribute MUST, on getting, return the value of the

              to the event loop to prevent race conditions.
              The value does not include framing overhead incurred by the

              [[\ReadyState]]</a> slot is <code>open</code>; however, the
              slot does not reset to zero once the channel closes. When the
              <a>underlying data transport</a> sends data from its queue, the
              user agent MUST queue a task that reduces
