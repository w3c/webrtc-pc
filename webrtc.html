    === NOTA BENE ===
    For the three scripts below, if your spec resides on dev.w3 you can check them
    out in the same tree and use relative links so that they'll work offline.

    To tag a new releas in git hub

        Once the version is checked in and ready to go, you tag it with (need
        to chance the 20110823 to correct date )

             git tag -a v20110823 -m "This is release 20110823"

       Tags are not transferred by default with the push so you have to
       add a - -tags parameter to the push so it looks like. Note you need to
       remoce the space between the - and -tag to make a double dash. 

            git push - -tags 

       or alternatively you can push just the new tag with 

            git push origin v20110823


    To generate the dated version of the specification:

       Open this doc in Mozilla. 

       Do a CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-S

       Select "XHMTL( source)" from dialog box. This will pop a new tab with
       genreated version of the document.

       This will open a new tab with generated html. Copy and paste this to
       a new file. Note if you use Chrome or Safari, this step will not
       work. What will happen is the paste will have the original document,
       not what was displayed in the window that you did the copy on.

       Rename the new file to the correct day such as
       webrtc-broken-20111003.html then search for and edit the links for
       "This version" and "Previos version". Add the new file into CVS and
       check in. 

       Once everyone is happy, the webrtc-broken.html and
       webrtc-broken-20111003.html files can be coppied to
       webrtc.html and webrtc-20111003.html
       respectively in the ../editor/. directory.

    <p>This document defines a set of APIs to represent streaming media,
    including audio and video, in JavaScript, to allow media to be sent over
    the network to another browser or device implementing the appropriate set
    of real-time protocols, and media received from another browser or device
    to be processed and displayed locally. This specification is being
    developed in conjunction with a protocol specification developed by the
    IETF RTCWEB group and an API specification to get access to local media
    devices developed by the Media Capture Task Force.</p>

  <section id="conformance">
    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in

  </section>

  <section id="sotd">
    <p>This document is not complete. It is subject to major changes and, while
    early experimentations are encouraged, it is therefore not intended for
    implementation. The API is based on preliminary work done in the WHATWG.
    The Web Real-Time Communications Working Group expects this specification
    to evolve significantly based on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The outcomes of ongoing exchanges in the companion RTCWEB group at
      IETF to define the set of protocols that, together with this document,
      will enable real-time communications in Web browsers.</li>

      <li>Privacy issues that arise when exposing local capabilities and local
      streams.</li>

      <li>Technical discussions within the group, on the data channel in
      particular.</li>

      <li>Experience gained through early experimentations.</li>

      <li>Feedback received from other groups and individuals.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As the specification matures, the group hopes to strike the right
    balance between a low-level API that would enable interested parties to
    tweak potentially complex system parameters, and a more high-level API that
    Web developers can use without <em>a priori</em> technical knowledge about
    real-time communications.</p>

    <h2>Network Stream API</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <p>The <code>MediaStream</code> interface, as defined in the
      [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] specification, typically represents a stream of data of
      audio and/or video. This object may be extended to also represent a stream
      that either comes from or is sent to a remote node (and not just the local
      camera, for instance). The extensions required to enable this capability
      on the <code>MediaStream</code> object will be described in this
      document.</p>

      <p>A <code>MediaStream</code> as definedin [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] may contain
      one of more <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s. A
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> sent to another peer MUST appear as one and
      only one <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> to the recipient.</p>

      <p>Channels are the smallest unit considered in the
      <code>MediaStream</code> specification. Channels are intended to be
      encoded together for transmission as, for instance, an RTP payload type.
      All of the channels that a codec needs to encode the media MUST be in the
      same <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> and the codecs SHOULD be able to
      encode, or discard, all the channels in the track.</p>

      <p>The concepts of an input and output to a given
      <code>MediaStream</code> apply in the case of <code>MediaStream</code>s
      transmitted over the network as well. A <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>
      created by a <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code>object (later described in
      this document) will take as input the data received from a remote peer.
      Similarly, a <code>MediaStream</code> from a local source, for instance a
      camera via [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] will have an output that represents what is
      transmitted to a remote peer if the object is used with a
      <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>

      <p>The concept of duplicating <code>MediaStream</code>s as described in
      [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] is also applicable here. This feature can be used, for
      instance, in a video-conferencing scenario to display the local video
      from the user’s camera and microphone in a local monitor, while only
      transmitting the audio to the remote peer (e.g. in response to the user
      using a "video mute" feature). Combining tracks from different
      <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> objects into a new
      <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> is useful in certain cases.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Interface definitions</h3>

      <p class='note'>In this section, we only specify aspects of the the
      following objects that are relevant when used along with a
      <code>PeerConnection</code>. Please refer to the original definitions of
      the objects in the [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] document for general information on
      using <code>MediaStream</code>s and <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s both
      in and outside the context of <code>PeerConnection</code>s.</p>

      <section>
        <h4>MediaStream</h4>

        <section>
          <h4>label</h4>

          <p>The <code>label</code> attribute specified in
          <code>MediaStream</code> returns a label that is unique to this
          stream, so that streams can be recognized after they are sent through
          the <code><a href="#peerconnection">PeerConnection</a></code>
          API.</p>

          <p>When a <code><a href="#mediastream">MediaStream</a></code> is
          created to represent a stream obtained from a remote peer, the
          <code title='dom-MediaStream-label'><a href=
          "#dom-mediastream-label">label</a></code> attribute is initialized
          from information provided by the remote source.</p>

          <p class='note'>The label of a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object
          is unique to the source of the stream, but that does not mean it is
          not possible to end up with duplicates. For example, a locally
          generated stream could be sent from one user to a remote peer using
          <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code>, and then sent back to the
          original user in the same manner, in which case the original user
          will have multiple streams with the same label (the locally-generated
          one and the one received from the remote peer).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Events on MediaStream</h4>

          <p>A new media component may be associated with an existing
          <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>. This happens, e.g., on the A-side
          when the B-side adds a new <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>
          object to one of the track lists of a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>
          that is being sent over a <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code>. If this
          happens for the reason exemplified, or for any other reason than the
          <code><a href="#dom-mediastreamtracklist-add">add()</a></code> method
          being invoked locally on a <code><a>MediaStreamTrackList</a></code>
          or tracks are being added as the stream is created (i.e. the stream
          is initialized with tracks), the user agent MUST run the following
          steps:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Create a <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object
              <var>track</var> to represent the new media component.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>If <var>track’s</var> <code><a href=
              "#dom-mediastreamtrack-kind">kind</a></code> attribute equals
              "<code>audio</code>", add it to the
              <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object’s <code><a href=
              "#dom-mediastream-audiotracks">audioTracks</a></code>
              <code><a>MediaStreamTrackList</a></code> object.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>If <var>track’s</var> <code><a href=
              "#dom-mediastreamtrack-kind">kind</a></code> attribute equals
              "<code>video</code>", add it to the
              <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object’s <code><a href=
              "#dom-mediastream-videotracks">videoTracks</a></code>
              <code><a>MediaStreamTrackList</a></code> object.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p><a>Fire a track event</a> named <code><a href=
              "#event-mediastreamtracklist-addtrack">addtrack</a></code> with
              the newly created <var>track</var> at the
              <code><a>MediaStreamTrackList</a></code> object.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>An existing media component may also be disassociated from a
          <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>. If this happens for any other reason
          than the <code><a href=
          "#dom-mediastreamtracklist-remove">remove()</a></code> method being
          invoked locally on a <code><a>MediaStreamTrackList</a></code> or the
          stream is being destroyed, the user agent MUST run the following
          steps:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Let <var>track</var> be the
              <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object representing the
              media component about to be removed.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Remove <var>track</var> from the
              <code><a>MediaStreamTrackList</a></code> object.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p><a>Fire a track event</a> named <code><a href=
              "#event-mediastreamtracklist-removetrack">removetrack</a></code>
              with <var>track</var> at the
              <code><a>MediaStreamTrackList</a></code> object.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>The event source for the <code>onended</code> event in the
          networked case is the <code>PeerConnection</code> object.</p>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>MediaStreamTrack</h4>

        <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>'s reference to it's
        <code>MediaStream</code> in the non-local media source case (an RTP
        source, as is the case for <code>MediaStream</code>s received over a
        <code>PeerConnection</code> is always strong.</p>

        <p>When a track belongs to a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> that comes
        from a remote peer and the remote peer has permanently stopped sending
        data the <code>ended</code> event MUST be fired on the track, as
        specified in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].</p>

        <p>A track in a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>, received with a
        <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code>, MUST have its <code><a href=
        "#dom-mediastreamtrack-readystate">readyState</a></code> attribute set
        to <code><a href="#widl-MediaStreamTrack-MUTED">MUTED</a></code> (1)
        until media data arrives.</p>

        <p>In addition, a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> has its readyState set
        to <code>MUTED</code> on the B-side if the A-side disables the
        corresponding <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> in the
        <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> that is being sent. When the addstream
        event triggers on a <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code>, all
        <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> objects in the resulting
        <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> are muted until media data can be read
        from the RTP source.</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>AudioMediaStreamTrack</h4>

      <p>The <code><a>AudioMediaStreamTrack</a></code> is a specialization of
      of a normal <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> that only carries audio
      and is extended to have the capability to send and/or receive DTMF
      codes.</p>

      <dl title='interface AudioMediaStreamTrack : MediaStreamTrack' class=
      'idl'>
        <dt>readonly attribute boolean canInsertDTMF</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The <dfn id=
          'dom-audiomediastreamtrack-caninsertdtmf'><code>canInsertDTMF</code></dfn>
          attribute MUST indicate if the
          <code><a>AudioMediaStreamTrack</a></code> is capable of sending
          DTMF.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>void insertDTMF(in DOMString tones, optional long duration)</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>When a <code><a>AudioMediaStreamTrack</a></code> object’s <dfn id=
          'dom-AudioMediaStreamTrack-insertDTMF'><code>insertDTMF()</code></dfn>
          method is invoked, the user agent MUST queue a task that that sends
          the DTMF tones.</p>

          <p>The tone parameters is treated as a series of characters. The
          characters 0 to 9, A to D, #, and * generated the associated DTMF
          tones. The characters a to d are equivalent to A to D. The character
          , indicates a an delay of 2 seconds before processing the next
          character in the tones parameter. Unrecognized characters are
          ignored.</p>

          <p>The duration parameters indicates the duration in ms to play the
          each DTMF passed in the tones parameters. The duration can not be
          more than 6000 or less than 70. The default duration is 100 ms for
          each tone. The gap between tones MUST be at least 50 ms but should be
          as short as possible.</p>

          <p>If insertDTMF is called on the same object while an existing task
          for this object is generate DTMF is still running, the previous task
          is canceled. Calling insertDTMF with an empty tones parameter can be
          used to cancel any tones currently being send.</p>

          <p class='note'>Editor Note: We need to add a callback that is set on
          the object that is called after the tones are sent. This is needed to
          allow the application to know when it can send new tones without
          canceling the tones that are currently being sent.</p>

          <p class='note'>Editor Note: It seems we would want a callback or

    <h2>Peer-to-peer connections</h2>

    <p>A <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code> allows two users to communicate
    directly, browser-to-browser. Communications are coordinated via a
    signaling channel provided by script in the page via the server, e.g. using
    <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</p>

    <p>Calling <code>new <a>PeerConnection</a>(<var>configuration</var>,
    <var>signalingCallback</var>)</code> creates a
    <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>

    <p>The <var>configuration</var> string gives the address of a STUN or TURN
    server to use to establish the connection. [[!STUN]] [[!TURN]]</p>

    <p>The allowed formats for this string are:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>"<code><var>TYPE</var> 203.0.113.2:3478</code>"</dt>

      <dd>
        <p>Indicates a specific IP address and port for the server.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>"<code><var>TYPE</var> relay.example.net:3478</code>"</dt>

      <dd>
        <p>Indicates a specific host and port for the server; the user agent
        will look up the IP address in DNS.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>"<code><var>TYPE</var> example.net</code>"</dt>

      <dd>
        <p>Indicates a specific domain for the server; the user agent will look
        up the IP address and port in DNS.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The "<code><var>TYPE</var></code>" is one of:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>STUN</code></dt>

      <dd>Indicates a STUN server</dd>

      <dt><code>STUNS</code></dt>

      <dd>Indicates a STUN server that is to be contacted using a TLS
      session.</dd>

      <dt><code>TURN</code></dt>

      <dd>Indicates a TURN server</dd>

      <dt><code>TURNS</code></dt>

      <dd>Indicates a TURN server that is to be contacted using a TLS
      session.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The <var>signalingCallback</var> argument is a method that will be
    invoked when the user agent needs to send a message to the other host over
    the signaling channel. When the callback is invoked, convey its first
    argument (a string) to the other peer using whatever method is being used
    by the Web application to relay signaling messages. (Messages returned from
    the other peer are provided back to the user agent using the <code><a href=
    "#dom-peerconnection-processsignalingmessage">processSignalingMessage()</a></code>
    method.)</p>

    <p>A <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code> object has an associated <dfn id=
    'peerconnection-signaling-callback'><code>PeerConnection</code> signaling
    callback</dfn>, a <dfn id=
    'peerconnection-ice-agent'><code>PeerConnection</code> ICE Agent</dfn>, 
    <!--a <dfn id=

  stream</dfn>, -->
     a <dfn id='peerconnection-readiness-state'><code>PeerConnection</code>
    readiness state</dfn> and an <dfn id='ice-started-flag'>SDP Agent</dfn>.
    These are initialized when the object is created.</p>

    <p>When the <dfn id=
    'dom-peerconnection'><code>PeerConnection()</code></dfn> constructor is
    invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps. This algorithm has a
    synchronous section (which is triggered as part of the event loop
    algorithm). Steps in the synchronous section are marked with ⌛.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Let <var>serverConfiguration</var> be the constructor’s first
        argument.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Let <var>signalingCallback</var> be the constructor’s second
        argument.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Let <var>connection</var> be a newly created
        <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>
      </li>

        <p>If <var>configuration components</var> has two or more components,

        </ul>

        <p>...then run the following substeps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Let <var>server type</var> be STUN if the first component of

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let <var>host</var> be the contents of the second component of

          </li>

          <li>

              <li>If <var>secure</var> is true, the server is to be contacted
              using TLS-over-TCP, otherwise, it is to be contacted using

              <li>The IP address, host name, or domain name of the server is
              <var title="">host</var>.</li>

              <li>The port to use is <var>port</var>. If this is the empty
              string, then only a domain name is configured (and the ICE Agent

        ⌛.)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>⌛ If the ice state is set to NEW, it MUST queue a task to start
        gathering ICE address and set the ice state to ICE_GATHERING.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>⌛ Once the ICE address gathering is complete, if there are any
        streams in localStreams, the SDP Agent will send the initial the SDP
        offer. The initial SDP offer MUST contain both the ICE candidate
        information as well as the SDP to represent the media descriptions for
        all the streams in localStreams.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>During the lifetime of the peerConnection object, the following
    procedures are followed:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>If a local media stream has been added and an SDP offer needs to be
        sent, and the ICE state is not NEW or ICE_GATHERING, and the SDP Agent
        state is NEW or SDP_IDLE, then send and queue a task to send an SDP
        offer and change the SPD state to SDP Waiting.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>If an SDP offer has been received, and the SDP state is NEW or
        SDP_IDLE, pass the ICE candidates from the SDP offer to the ICE Agent
        and change it state to ICE_CHECKING. Construct an appropriate SDP
        answer, update the remote streams, queue a task to send the SDP offer,
        and set the SDPAgent state to SDP_IDLE.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>At the point the sdpState changes from NEW to some other state, the
        readyState changes to NEGOTIATING.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>If the ICE Agent finds a candidates that froms a valid connection,
        the ICE state is changed to ICE_CONNECTED</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>If the ICE Agent finishes checking all candidates, if a connection
        has been found, the ice state is changed to ICE_COMPLETED and if not
        connection has been found it is changed to ICE_FAILED.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>If the iceState is ICE_CONNECTED or ICE_COMPLETED and the SDP stat
        is SDP_IDLE, the readyState is set to ACTIVE.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>If the iceState is ICE_FAILED, a task is queued to calls the close
        method.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The close method will cause the system to wait until the sdpStat is
        SDP_IDLE then it will send an SDP offer terminating all media and
        change the readyState to CLOSING as well as stop all ICE process and
        change the iceState to ICE_CLOSED. Once an SDP anser to this offer is
        received, the readyState will be changed to CLOSED.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>User agents MAY negotiate any codec and any resolution, bitrate, or
    other quality metric. User agents are encouraged to initially negotiate for
    the native resolution of the stream. For streams that are then rendered
    (using a <code>video</code> element), user agents are encouraged to
    renegotiate for a resolution that matches the rendered display size.</p>

    <p class="note">Starting with the native resolution means that if the Web
    application notifies its peer of the native resolution as it starts sending
    data, and the peer prepares its <code>video</code> element accordingly,
    there will be no need for a renegotiation once the stream is flowing.</p>

    <p>All SDP media descriptions for streams represented by
    <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> objects MUST include a label attribute
    ("<code title="">a=label:</code>") whose value is the value of the
    <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object’s <code title=
    'dom-MediaStream-label'><a href="#dom-mediastream-label">label</a></code>
    attribute. [[!SDP]] [[!SDPLABEL]]</p>

    <p><a href="#peerconnection"><code>PeerConnection</code>s</a> MUST not
    generate any candidates for media streams whose media descriptions do not
    have a label attribute ("<code>a=label:</code>"). [[!ICE]] [[!SDP]]
    [[!SDPLABEL]]</p>

    <p>When a user agent has reached the point in the media negotiation where a
    <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> can be created to represent incoming
    components, the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Let <var>connection</var> be the <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code>
        expecting this media.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Create a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object to represent the
        media stream. Set its <code><a href=
        "#dom-mediastream-label">label</a></code> attribute to the value of the
        SDP Label attribute for that component’s media stream.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Run the following steps for each component in the media stream.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Create a <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object
            <var>track</var> to represent the component.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If <var>track’s</var> <code><a href=
            "#dom-mediastreamtrack-kind">kind</a></code> attribute equals
            "<code>audio</code>", add it to the <code><a>MediaStream</a></code>
            object’s <code><a href=
            "#dom-mediastream-audiotracks">audioTracks</a></code>
            <code><a>MediaStreamTrackList</a></code> object.</p>

    <p>If a <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code> object is <a title=
    "consumer">consuming</a> a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> and a track is
    added to one of the stream’s <code><a>MediaStreaMtrackList</a></code>
    objects, by, e.g., the <code><a href=
    "#dom-mediastreamtracklist-add">add()</a></code> method being invoked, the
    <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code> object MUST add a media component for
    that track the next time the user agent <span title=

    MUST also remove a media component in same way.</p>

    <p class="warning">To prevent network sniffing from allowing a fourth party
    to establish a connection to a peer using the information sent out-of-band
    to the other peer and thus spoofing the client, the configuration
    information SHOULD always be transmitted using an encrypted connection.</p>

          <p>When a message is relayed from the remote peer over the signaling

          <p>The order of messages is important. Passing messages to the user
          agent in a different order than they were generated by the remote

      <h3>DataChannel</h3>

      <p>The <code><a>DataChannel</a></code> interface represents a
      bi-directional data channel between two peers. A
      <code><a>DataChannel</a></code> is created via a factory method on a
      <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code> object. The corresponding
      <code><a>DataChannel</a></code> object is then dispatched at the other
      peer if the channel setup was successful.</p>

      <p>Each <code><a>DataChannel</a></code> has an associated <dfn>underlying
      data transport</dfn> that is used to transport actual data to the other
      peer. The transport properties of the <a>underlying data transport</a>,
      such as reliability mode, is configured by the peer taking the initiative
      to create the channel. The receiving peer cannot change any transport
      properties of a offered data channel. The actual wire protocol between
      the peers is out of the scope for this specification.</p>

      <p>A <code><a>DataChannel</a></code> created with <code><a href=
      "#dom-peerconnection-createdatachannel">createDataChannel()</a></code>
      MUST initially be in the <code><a href=
      "#widl-DataChannel-CONNECTING">CONNECTING</a></code> (0) state. If the
      <code><a>DataChannel</a></code> object’s <a>underlying data transport</a>
      is successfully set up, the user agent MUST <a href=
      "#announce-datachannel-open">announce the <code>DataChannel</code> as
      open</a>.</p>

      <p>When the user agent is to <dfn id="announce-datachannel-open">announce
      a <code>DataChannel</code> as open</dfn>, the user agent MUST queue a
      task to run the following steps:</p>

      <ol>

          <p>If the associated <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code> object’s
          <a href="#peerconnection-readiness-state"><code>PeerConnection</code>
          readiness state</a> is <code><a href=
          "#widl-PeerConnection-CLOSED">CLOSED</a></code> (3), abort these
          steps.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Let <var>channel</var> be the <code><a>DataChannel</a></code>
          object to be announced.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Set <var>channel</var>’s <code><a href=

        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>When an <a>underlying data transport</a> has been established, the
      user agent, of the peer that did not initiate the creation process MUST
      queue a task to run the following steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>If the associated <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code> object’s

          steps.</p>
        </li>

        <li>

    <h2>Garbage collection</h2>

    <p>A <code>Window</code> object <dfn id='concept-peerconnection-owner'>has
    a strong reference</dfn> to any <code><a>PeerConnection</a></code> objects
    created from the constructor whose global object is that
    <code>Window</code> object.</p><!-- we
  could be less strict here, e.g. dropping the reference when there’s
  no way for an event to be fired because there’s no event handlers
  registered and there’s no way for the remote peer to notice anything
  because no media is streaming; or e.g. dropping the reference when
  the object reaches the CLOSED state. But as dropping the reference
  in those cases is black-box indistinguishable from keeping the
  reference, I haven't bothered to work out the exact rules. If you do
  change this, see the /unloading document cleanup steps/. -->

      <dt>Encoding considerations:</dt>

      <dd>This MIME type defines a binary protocol format which uses UTF-8 for
      text encoding.</dd>

      <dt>Security considerations:</dt>

      <dd>
        <p>This format is used for encoding UDP packets transmitted by
        potentially hostile Web page content via a trusted user agent to a
        destination selected by a potentially hostile remote server. To prevent
        this mechanism from being abused for cross-protocol attacks, all the
        data in these packets is masked so as to appear to be random noise. The
        intent of this masking is to reduce the potential attack scenarios to
        those already possible previously.</p>

        <p>However, this feature still allows random data to be sent to
        destinations that might not normally have been able to receive them,
        such as to hosts within the victim’s intranet. If a service within such
        an intranet cannot handle receiving UDP packets containing random
        noise, it might be vulnerable to attack from this feature.</p>

      <dt>Interoperability considerations:</dt>

      <dd>Rules for processing both conforming and non-conforming content are
      defined in this specification.</dd>

    <h2>Change Log</h2>

    <p>This section will be removed before publication.</p>

    <h3>To Do Items</h3>

    <p>Need a way to indicate the type of the SDP when passing SDP strings.</p>

    <h3>Changes since 21 April 2012</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Moved MediaStream and related definitions to getUserMedia.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Changes since 12 January 2012</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Clarified what relation of Stream, Track, and Channel.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Changes since 17 October 2011</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Tweak the introduction text and add a reference to the IETF RTCWEB
      group.</li>

      <li>Changed the first argument to getUserMedia to be an object.</li>

      <li>Added a MediaStreamHints object as a second argument to
      PeerConnection.addStream.</li>

      <li>Added AudioMediaStreamTrack class and DTMF interface.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Changes since 23 August 2011</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Separated the SDP and ICE Agent into separate agents and added
      explicit state attributes for each.</li>

      <li>Removed the send method from PeerConenction and associated callback
      function.</li>

      <li>Modified MediaStream() constructor to take a list of MediaStreamTrack
      objects instead of a MediaStream. Removed text about MediaStream parent
      and child relationship.</li>

      <li>Added abstract.</li>

      <li>Moved a few paragraphs from the MediaStreamTrack.label section to the
      MediaStream.label section (where they belong).</li>

      <li>Split MediaStream.tracks into MediaStream.audioTracks and
      MediaStream.videoTracks.</li>

      <li>Removed a sentence that implied that track access is limited to
      LocalMediaStream.</li>

      <li>Updated a few getUserMedia()-examples to use MediaStreamOptions.</li>

      <li>Replaced calls to URL.getObjectURL() with URL.createObjectURL() in
      example code.</li>

      <li>Fixed some broken getUserMedia() links.</li>

      <li>Introduced state handling on MediaStreamTrack (removed state handling
      from MediaStream).</li>

      <li>Reintroduced onended on MediaStream to simplify checking if all
      tracks are ended.</li>

      <li>Aligned the MediaStreamTrack ended event dispatching behavior with
      that of MediaStream.</li>

      <li>Updated the LocalMediaStream.stop() algorithm to implicitly use the
      end track algorithm.</li>

      <li>Replaced an occurrence the term finished track with ended track (to
      align with rest of spec).</li>

      <li>Moved (and extended) the explanation about track references and media
      sources from LocalMediaStream to MediaStreamTrack.</li>

      <li>Removed section "Obtaining local multimedia content".</li>

      <li>Updated getUserMedia() calls in examples (changes in Media Capture TF
      spec).</li>

      <li>Introduced MediaStreamTrackList interface with support for adding and
      removing tracks.</li>

      <li>Updated the algorithm that is run when PeerConnection receives a
      stream (create new stream when negotiated instead of when data
      arrives).</li>

      <li>Removed some left-overs from the old Data Stream API.</li>

      <li>Initial import of new Data API.</li>

      <li>Renamed "underlying data channel" to "underlying data transport".
      Fixed closing procedures. Fixed some typos.</li>
