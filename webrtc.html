    <!--
     === NOTA BENE ===
      For the three scripts below, if your spec resides on dev.w3 you can check them
      out in the same tree and use relative links so that they'll work offline.

      To tag a new releas in git hub

          Once the version is checked in and ready to go, you tag it with (need
          to chance the 20110823 to correct date )

               git tag -a v20120323 -m "This is release 20120323"

         Tags are not transferred by default with the push so you have to
         add a - -tags parameter to the push so it looks like. Note you need to
         remoce the space between the - and -tag to make a double dash. 

              git push - -tags 

         or alternatively you can push just the new tag with 

              git push origin v20120323


      To generate the dated version of the specification:

           Open this doc in Mozilla. 

           Do a CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-S

           Select "XHMTL( source)" from dialog box. This will pop a new tab with
           genreated version of the document.

           This will open a new tab with generated html. Copy and paste this to
           a new file. Note if you use Chrome or Safari, this step will not
           work. What will happen is the paste will have the original document,
           not what was displayed in the window that you did the copy on.

           Rename the new file to the correct day such as
           webrtc-broken-20111003.html then search for and edit the links for
           "This version" and "Previos version". Add the new file into CVS and
           check in. 

           Once everyone is happy, the webrtc-broken.html and
           webrtc-broken-20111003.html files can be coppied to
           webrtc.html and webrtc-20111003.html
           respectively in the ../editor/. directory.

      <p> This is not a product of the WebRTC WG - it is merely a document
      being used to discuss possible changes to the documents that WG is
      developing. Much of the text here is from the WG document.</p>

      <p>This document defines a set of APIs to represent streaming media,
      including audio and video, in JavaScript, to allow media to be sent over
      the network to another browser or device implementing the appropriate
      set of real-time protocols, and media received from another browser or
      device to be processed and displayed locally. This specification is
      being developed in conjunction with a protocol specification developed
      by the IETF RTCWEB group and an API specification to get access to local
      media devices developed by the Media Capture Task Force.</p>

      <p> Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in

      this specification to evolve significantly based on:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The outcomes of ongoing exchanges in the companion RTCWEB group at
        IETF to define the set of protocols that, together with this document,

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>There are a number of facets to video-conferencing in HTML covered by
      this specification:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Representing a multimedia stream (video, audio, or both) from
        local devices (video cameras, microphones, Web cams) or from
        prerecorded files provided by the user.</li>

        <li>Recording such streams locally.</li>

        <li>Connecting to remote peers using NAT-traversal technologies such
        as ICE, STUN, and TURN.</li>

        <li>Sending the locally-produced streams to remote peers and receiving
        streams from remote peers.</li>

        <li>Displaying such streams (both the locally-produced ones and the
        remotely-obtained ones) locally using the <code>video</code> or
        <code>audio</code> elements.</li>

        <li>Sending arbitrary data to remote peers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This document defines the APIs used for these features. This
      specification is being developed in conjunction with a protocol
      specification developed by the <a
      href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rtcweb/">IETF RTCWEB group</a> and
      an API specification to get access to local media devices developed by

      <h2>Peer-to-peer connections</h2>

      <p>A <code>
          <a>PeerConnection</a>
        </code> allows two users to communicate directly, browser to browser.
      Communications are coordinated via a signaling channel provided by
      script in the page via the server, e.g. using
      <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</p>

      <p>Calling <code>new <a>PeerConnection</a>(<var>configuration</var>
      )</code> creates a <code>
          <a>PeerConnection</a>
        </code> object.</p>

      <p>The <var>configuration</var> has the information to find and access the
       [[!STUN]] and [[!TURN]] servers along. </p>

      <p>An example configuration array is:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>
          <code>[ ["stun:stun.example.org"] ,
          ["turn:user@turn.example.org","myPassword"] ]</code>
        </dt>
      </dl>

      <p>A <code>
          <a>PeerConnection</a>
        </code> object has an associated a <dfn
      id="peerconnection-ice-agent"><code>PeerConnection</code> ICE
      Agent</dfn>, and a <dfn
      id="peerconnection-readiness-state"><code>PeerConnection</code>
      readiness state</dfn>. These are initialized when the object is
      created.</p>

      <p>When the <dfn id="dom-peerconnection">
          <code>PeerConnection()</code>
        </dfn> constructor is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following
      steps. This algorithm has a synchronous section (which is triggered as
      part of the event loop algorithm). Steps in the synchronous section are
      marked with ⌛.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Create an ICE Agent and let <var>connection</var>’s <a
          href="#peerconnection-ice-agent"><code>PeerConnection</code> ICE
          Agent</a> be that ICE Agent and provide it the STUN and TURN servers
          from the configuration array. [[!ICE]]</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Set <var>connection</var>’s <a
          href="#peerconnection-readiness-state"><code>PeerConnection</code>
          readiness state</a> to <code>
              <a href="#widl-PeerConnection-NEW">NEW</a>
            </code> (0). </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Set <var>connection</var>’s <a
          href="#peerconnection-readiness-state"><code>PeerConnection</code>
          ice state </a> to <code>
              <a href="#widl-PeerConnection-NEW">NEW</a>
            </code> (0). </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Let <var>connection</var>’s <code
              title="dom-PeerConnection-localStreams">
              <a href="#widl-PeerConnection-localStreams">localStreams</a>
            </code> attribute be an empty read-only <code>
              <a>MediaStream</a>
            </code> array. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Let <var>connection</var>’s <code
              title="dom-PeerConnection-remoteStreams">
              <a href="#widl-PeerConnection-remoteStreams">remoteStreams</a>
            </code> attribute be an empty read-only <code>
              <a>MediaStream</a>
            </code> array. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Return <var>connection</var>, but continue these steps
          asynchronously.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Await a stable state. The synchronous section consists of the
          remaining steps of this algorithm. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>If the ice state is set to NEW, it MUST queue a task to start
          gathering ICE address and set the ice state to ICE_GATHERING.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p> During the lifetime of the PeerConnection object, the following
      procedures are followed: </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p> If the ICE Agent finds a candidates that forms a valid
          connection, the ICE state is changed to ICE_CONNECTED </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> If the ICE Agent finishes checking all candidates, if a
          connection has been found, the ice state is changed to ICE_COMPLETED
          and if not connection has been found it is changed to ICE_FAILED.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> If the iceState is ICE_CONNECTED or ICE_COMPLETED and the SDP
          stat is SDP_IDLE, the readyState is set to ACTIVE. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> If the iceState is ICE_FAILED, a task is queued to calls the
          close method. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> The close method will stop all ICE process and change the
          iceState to ICE_CLOSED. </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>User agents MAY negotiate any codec and any resolution, bitrate, or
      other quality metric. User agents are encouraged to initially negotiate
      for the native resolution of the stream. For streams that are then
      rendered (using a <code>video</code> element), user agents are
      encouraged to renegotiate for a resolution that matches the rendered
      display size.</p>

      <p class="note">Starting with the native resolution means that if the
      Web application notifies its peer of the native resolution as it starts
      sending data, and the peer prepares its <code>video</code> element
      accordingly, there will be no need for a renegotiation once the stream
      is flowing.</p>

      <p>All SDP media descriptions for streams represented by <code>
          <a>MediaStream</a>
        </code> objects MUST include a label attribute ("<code
      title="">a=label:</code>") whose value is the value of the <code>
          <a>MediaStream</a>
        </code> object's <code title="dom-MediaStream-label">
          <a href="#dom-mediastream-label">label</a>
        </code> attribute. [[!SDP]] [[!SDPLABEL]]</p>

      <p><a href="#peerconnection"><code>PeerConnection</code>s</a> MUST not
      generate any candidates for media streams whose media descriptions do
      not have a label attribute ("<code>a=label:</code>"). [[!ICE]] [[!SDP]]
      [[!SDPLABEL]]</p>

      <p>When a user agent has reached the point in the media negotiation
      where a <code>
          <a>MediaStream</a>
        </code> can be created to represent incoming components, the user
      agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Let <var>connection</var> be the <code>
              <a>PeerConnection</a>
            </code> expecting this media.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Create a <code>
              <a>MediaStream</a>
            </code> object to represent the media stream. Set its <code>
              <a href="#dom-mediastream-label">label</a>
            </code> attribute to the value of the SDP Label attribute for that
          component's media stream.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Run the following steps for each component in the media
          stream.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Create a <code>
                  <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
                </code> object <var>track</var> to represent the
              component.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>If <var>track's</var> <code>
                  <a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-kind">kind</a>
                </code> attribute equals "<code>audio</code>", add it to the
              <code>

                </code> <code>

                  <a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-kind">kind</a>
                </code> attribute equals "<code>video</code>", add it to the
              <code>

            </li>

              <a>MediaStreamTrackList</a>
            </code> objects on the receiving side should reflect the order on
          the sending side. One way to enforce this is to specify the order in

          <dd>
            <p> The createOffer method generates a blob of SDP that contains a
            RFC offer with the supported configurations for the session,
            including descriptions of the local MediaStreams attached to this
            PeerConnection, the codec/RTP/RTCP options supported by this
            implementation, and any candidates that have been gathered by the
            ICE Agent. The constraints parameter may be supplied to provide
            additional control over the offer generated. </p>

            <p> As an offer, the generated SDP will contain the full set of
            capabilities supported by the session (as opposed to an answer,
            which will include only a specific negotiated subset to use); for
            each SDP line, the generation of the SDP must follow the appropriate
            process for generating an offer. In the event createOffer is called
            after the session is established, createOffer will generate an offer
            that is compatible with the current session, incorporating any
            changes that have been made to the session since the last complete
            offer-answer exchange, such as addition or removal of streams. If no
            changes have been made, the offer will be include the capabilities

            capabilities that could be negotiated in an updated offer. </p>

            <p> Session descriptions generated by createOffer MUST be
            immediately usable by setLocalDescription without causing an error
            as long as setLocalDiscription is called within the successCallback
            function. If a system has limited resources (e.g. a finite number of
            decoders), createOffer needs to return an offer that reflects the
            current state of the system, so that setLocalDescription will
            succeed when it attempts to acquire those resources. The session
            descriptions MUST remain usable by setLocalDescription without
            causing an error until at least end of the successCallback
            function. Calling this method is needed to get the ICE user name

            this session, and any candidates that have been gathered by the
            ICE Agent. The constraints parameter may be supplied to provide
            additional control over the generated answer. </p>

            <p> As an answer, the generated SDP will contain a specific
            configuration that specifies how the media plane should be
            established. For each SDP line, the generation of the SDP must
            follow the appropriate process for generating an answer or
            provisional answer. </p>

            <p> Session descriptions generated by createAnswer
            must be immediately usable by setLocalDescription without generating
            an error; like createOffer, the returned description should reflect

            use of both the old and new local descriptions (e.g. support
            codecs that exist in both descriptions) until a final answer is
            received, at which point the PeerConnection can fully adopt the
            new local description, or roll back to the old description if the
            remote side denied the change. </p>

            the use to TURN candidates by a callee to avoid leaking location
            information prior to the call being accepted. </p>

            <p> This call may result in a change to the state of the ICE
            Agent, and may result in a change to media state if it results in
            connectivity being established. </p>

            <p> If the restart parameter is set to true, the ICE state machine
            discards all candidates it has gathers, allocates new ports for the
            host candidates, and restarts ICE as if there had been no previos
            ICE session. Applications can use this reset all ICE negotiation
            when something has gone terribly wrong.  </p>

            <p> A TBD exception will be thrown if constraints parameter is malformed.

      <p> The following new constraints are defined that can be used with a

      <dl>

             <dt> ReceiveVideo </dt>
        
        <dd> <p> This is a enum type constraint that can take the values "true"
        and "false". The default is a non mandatory "true" if the PeerConnection
        a video stream has been added no "false" otherwise. </p>

          <p> In some cases, a PeerConenction may wish to receive video but it
          is not going to send any video. The PeerConenction needs to know if it
          should signal to the remote side if it wishes to receive video or
          not. This constraints allows an application to indicate it's
          preferences for receiving video when creating an offer. </p> </dd>
        
        <dt> VoiceActivityDetection </dt>
        
        <dd> <p> This is a enum type constraint that can take the values "true"
        and "false". The default is a non mandatory "true". </p>

          <p> Many codecs and system are capable of detecting "silence" and
        changing there behavior in this case by doing things such as not
        transmitting any media. In many cases, such as when dealing with sounds
        other than spoken voice or emergency calling, it is desirable to be able
        to turn off this behavior. This constraints allows the application to
        provide information about if it wishes this type of processing enable or
        disabled.  </p> </dd>


        <dt> IceTransports </dt>

        <dd> <p> This is a enum type constraint that can take the values "none",
          "relay", and "all". The default is a non mandatory "all". </p>
          
        <dd> <p> This constraints indicates which candidates the ICE engine is
          restricted use. The value "none" means the ICE engine MUST not send or
          receive any packets at this point. The value "relay" indicates the ICE
          engine MUST only using media relay candidates such as candidates
          passing through a TURN server. This can be used to reduce leakage of
          IP addresses in certain use cases. The value of "all" indicates all
          values can be used. </p>

      <h2>Garbage collection</h2>

      <p>A <code>Window</code> object <dfn
      id="concept-peerconnection-owner">has a strong reference</dfn> to any
      <code>
          <a>PeerConnection</a>
        </code> objects created from the constructor whose global object is
      that <code>Window</code> object.</p>

      <!-- we could be less strict here, e.g. dropping the reference when
  there’s no way for an event to be fired because there’s no event handlers
  registered and there’s no way for the remote peer to notice anything because
  no media is streaming; or e.g. dropping the reference when the object reaches
  the CLOSED state. But as dropping the reference in those cases is black-box
  indistinguishable from keeping the reference, I haven't bothered to work out
  the exact rules. If you do change this, see the /unloading document cleanup
  steps/. -->

          <dd>
            <p>This format is used for encoding UDP packets transmitted by
            potentially hostile Web page content via a trusted user agent to a
            destination selected by a potentially hostile remote server. To
            prevent this mechanism from being abused for cross-protocol
            attacks, all the data in these packets is masked so as to appear
            to be random noise. The intent of this masking is to reduce the
            potential attack scenarios to those already possible
            previously.</p>

            <p>However, this feature still allows random data to be sent to
            destinations that might not normally have been able to receive
            them, such as to hosts within the victim's intranet. If a service
            within such an intranet cannot handle receiving UDP packets
            containing random noise, it might be vulnerable to attack from
            this feature.</p>

      <h2>Change Log</h2>

      <p> This section will be removed before publication. </p>

      <h3> To Do Items </h3>

      <p> Need a way to indicate the type of the SDP when passing SDP strings.
      </p>

      <h3> Changes since 12 January 2012</h3>

      <ol>
        <li> Clarified what relation of Stream, Track, and Channel. </li>
      </ol>

      <h3> Changes since 17 October 2011</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Tweak the introduction text and add a reference to the IETF RTCWEB
        group.</li>

        <li>Changed the first argument to getUserMedia to be an object.</li>

        <li>Added a MediaStreamHints object as a second argument to
        PeerConnection.addStream.</li>

        <li>Added AudioMediaStreamTrack class and DTMF interface.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3> Changes since 23 August 2011</h3>

      <ol>
        <li> Separated the SDP and ICE Agent into separate agents and added
        explicit state attributes for each. </li>

        <li> Removed the send method from PeerConenction and associated
        callback function. </li>

        <li>Modified MediaStream() constructor to take a list of
        MediaStreamTrack objects instead of a MediaStream. Removed text about
        MediaStream parent and child relationship.</li>

        <li>Added abstract.</li>

        <li>Moved a few paragraphs from the MediaStreamTrack.label section to
        the MediaStream.label section (where they belong).</li>

        <li>Split MediaStream.tracks into MediaStream.audioTracks and
        MediaStream.videoTracks.</li>

        <li>Removed a sentence that implied that track access is limited to
        LocalMediaStream.</li>

        <li>Updated a few getUserMedia()-examples to use
        MediaStreamOptions.</li>

        <li>Replaced calls to URL.getObjectURL() with URL.createObjectURL() in
        example code.</li>

        <li>Fixed some broken getUserMedia() links.</li>

        <li>Introduced state handling on MediaStreamTrack (removed state
        handling from MediaStream).</li>

        <li>Reintroduced onended on MediaStream to simplify checking if all
        tracks are ended.</li>

        <li>Aligned the MediaStreamTrack ended event dispatching behavior with
        that of MediaStream.</li>

        <li>Updated the LocalMediaStream.stop() algorithm to implicitly use
        the end track algorithm.</li>

        <li>Replaced an occurrence the term finished track with ended track
        (to align with rest of spec).</li>

        <li>Moved (and extended) the explanation about track references and
        media sources from LocalMediaStream to MediaStreamTrack.</li>

        <li>Removed section "Obtaining local multimedia content".</li>

        <li>Updated getUserMedia() calls in examples (changes in Media Capture
        TF spec).</li>

        <li>Introduced MediaStreamTrackList interface with support for adding
        and removing tracks.</li>

        <li>Updated the algorithm that is run when PeerConnection receives a
        stream (create new stream when negotiated instead of when data
        arrives).</li>
