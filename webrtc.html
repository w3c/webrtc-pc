    <p>This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to allow media
    to be sent to and received from another browser or device implementing the
    appropriate set of real-time protocols. This specification is being
    developed in conjunction with a protocol specification developed by the
    IETF RTCWEB group and an API specification to get access to local media
    devices developed by the Media Capture Task Force.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="sotd">
    <p>The API is based on preliminary work done in the WHATWG.</p>

    <p>While the specification is feature complete and is expected to be stable, there are also a number of <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20-label%3AEditorial%20">known substantive issues</a> on the specification that will be addressed during the Candidate Recommendation period based on implementation experience feedback.</p>

    <p>It might also evolve based on feedback gathered as its <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/webrtc">associated test suite</a> evolves. This test suite will be used to build an <a href="https://wpt.fyi/webrtc">implementation report</a> of the API.</p>

    <p>To go into Proposed Recommendation status, the group expects to demonstrate implementation of each feature in at least two deployed browsers, and at least one implementation of each optional feature. Mandatory feature with only one implementation may be marked as optional in a revised Candidate Recommendation where applicable.</p>

    <p>The following features are marked as risk:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The value <a href="#dom-rtcrtcpmuxpolicy-negotiate"><code>negotiate</code></a> of RTCRtcpMuxPolicy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>There are a number of facets to peer-to-peer communications and
    video-conferencing in HTML covered by this specification:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Connecting to remote peers using NAT-traversal technologies such as
      ICE, STUN, and TURN.</li>
      <li>Sending the locally-produced tracks to remote peers and receiving
      tracks from remote peers.</li>
      <li>Sending arbitrary data directly to remote peers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This document defines the APIs used for these features. This
    specification is being developed in conjunction with a protocol
    specification developed by the <a href=
    "https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rtcweb/">IETF RTCWEB group</a> and an API
    specification to get access to local media devices [[!GETUSERMEDIA]]
    developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Media_Capture">Media
    Capture Task Force</a>. An overview of the system can be found in
    [[RTCWEB-OVERVIEW]] and [[RTCWEB-SECURITY]].</p>

  <section id="conformance">
    <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
    product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it
    contains.</p>
    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
    implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
    particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
    easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>
    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
    this specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the
    ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL-1]], as
    this specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>An <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> instance allows an
      application to establish peer-to-peer communications with another
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> instance in another browser, or to
      another endpoint implementing the required protocols. Communications are coordinated by the
      exchange of control messages (called a signaling protocol) over a
      signaling channel which is provided by unspecified means, but generally
      by a script in the page via the server, e.g. using
      <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> [[XMLHttpRequest]] or Web Sockets
      [[WEBSOCKETS-API]].</p>

                which establishes which certificates are allowed. The
                <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> implementation selects which of
                the certificates is used for a given connection; how

                PoP (Proof-of-Possession) Token type, as described in
                [[!RFC6749]] and [[!OAUTH-POP-KEY-DISTRIBUTION]].

                <p>The <dfn>OAuth Client</dfn> and the <dfn>Auhorization

                <p>
                If [[!RFC7635]] is used in the WebRTC context then the <a>OAuth
                Client</a> is responsible for refreshing the credential
                information, and updating the <a>ICE Agent</a> with fresh new
                credentials before the <code>accessToken</code> expires. The
                <a>OAuth Client</a> can use the <a
                href="#interface-definition"><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a>
                <a data-lt="setConfiguration"
                href="#dom-rtcpeerconnection-setconfiguration"><code>
                setConfiguration</code></a> method to periodically refresh the
                TURN credentials. </p>
                <p>For OAuth Authentication, the <a>ICE Agent</a> requires three
                pieces of credential information. The credential is composed of
                a <code>kid</code>, which the <a>RTCIceServer</a>
                <code>username</code> member is used for, and
                <code>macKey</code> and <code> accessToken</code>, which are
                placed in the <a>RTCOAuthCredential</a> dictionary. All of this
                information can be extracted from the OAuth response parameters,
                which are received from the <dfn>Authorization Server</dfn>. The
                relevant OAuth response parameters are the "kid", the "key", and
                the "access_token". These can be used to extract all the
                necessary credential infromation (the <code>kid</code>,
                <code>macKey</code>, and <code>accessToken</code>) that are
                required by the <a>ICE Agent</a> for the Authentication.
                </p>
                <p>The [[!OAUTH-POP-KEY-DISTRIBUTION]] defines <dfn>alg</dfn>
                parameter in Section 4.1 and 6. and describes that if the
                <a>Authorization Server</a> doesn't have prior knowledge of the
                capabilities of the client, then the <a>OAuth Client</a> needs
                to provide information about the <a>ICE Agent</a> HMAC
                <a>alg</a> capabilities. This information helps the
                <a>Authorization Server</a> to generate the approriate HMAC key.
                The HMAC <a>alg</a> defines the input key length, and HMAC
                algorithm Familly (e.g. SHA), and HMAC algorithm type (e.g.
                symmetric/asymmetric).
                </p>
                <p>The <a>OAuth Client</a> sends an <code>OAuth Request</code>
                to the <a>Authorization Server</a> with OAuth param <a>alg</a>
                and further OAuth related parameters, to get an <code>OAuth
                Response</code> with the <code>access_token</code>,
                <code>key</code>, <code>kid</code>, and further OAuth related
                parameters.
                </p>
                <p>However, this specification uses a simplified <a>alg</a>
                approach. The length of the HMAC key
                (<code>RTCOAuthCredential.macKey</code>) MAY be any integer number of
                bytes greater than 20 (160 bits). This negates the need to query the HMAC
                Algorithm capabilities of the <a>ICE Agent</a>, and still
                allows for hash agility as described by [[STUN-BIS]], Section
                15.3.</p>
                <div class="note">According to [[!RFC7635]] Section 4.1, the
                HMAC key MUST be a symmetric key.
                </div>
                <p>Currently the STUN/TURN protocols use only SHA-1 and SHA-2
                family hash algorithms for Message Integrity Protection, as
                defined in [[!RFC5389]] Section 15.4, and [[!STUN-BIS]]
                Section 14.6.
                </p>
                <p>When [[!RFC7635]] is used in WebRTC context, this
                specification adds the following additional consideration to
                it.
                </p>
                <p>The <a>OAuth Client</a> SHOULD obtain the mac_key by
                requesting an <a>alg</a> value of <code>HS256</code>. This will
                result in a 256-bit HMAC key.
                </p>
                <p><code>HS256</code> is defined in [[!RFC7518]] Section 3.1.
                It is recommended here because:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The OAuth respose key parameter is received in JWK format
                  according to [[!OAUTH-POP-KEY-DISTRIBUTION]] Section 4.2.
                  JWK's algorithms are normatively registered in the IANA
                  "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry.
                  </li>
                  <li>STUN/TURN currently use SHA family HMAC algorithms only.
                  </li>
                  <li>The key MUST be symmetric, according to [[!RFC7635]].</li>
                  <li>A 256-bit key is large enough to support all currently

                Authenticated encryption is used for message encryption and
                integrity protection. The access token contains a non-encrypted
                nonce value, which is used by the Authorization Server for unique
                mac_key generation. The second part of the token is protected
                by Authenticated Encryption. It contains the mac_key, a
                timestamp and a lifetime. The timestamp combined with lifetime
                provides expiry information; this information describes the
                time window during which the token credential is valid and
                accepted by the TURN server.

      <h3>RTCPeerConnection Interface</h3>
      <p>The [[!JSEP]] specification, as a whole, describes the details of how
      the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> operates. References to
      specific subsections of [[!JSEP]] are provided as appropriate.</p>
      <section>
        <h4>Operation</h4>
        <p>Calling <code>new <a>RTCPeerConnection</a>(<var>configuration</var>)
        </code> creates an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>
        <p><code><var>configuration</var>.servers</code> contains information
        used to find and access the servers used by ICE. The application can
        supply multiple servers of each type, and any TURN server MAY also be
        used as a STUN server for the purposes of gathering server reflexive
        candidates.</p>
        <p>An <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object has a <dfn>signaling
        state</dfn>, a <dfn>connection state</dfn>, an <dfn>ICE gathering
        state</dfn>, and an <dfn>ICE connection state</dfn>. These are
        initialized when the object is created.</p>

        <p data-link-for="RTCPeerConnection">The ICE protocol implementation of
        an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> is represented by an <dfn>ICE
        agent</dfn> [[!ICE]]. Certain <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>
        methods involve interactions with the <a>ICE Agent</a>, namely
        <code><a>addIceCandidate</a></code>, <code><a>setConfiguration</a></code>,
        <code><a>setLocalDescription</a></code>,
        <code><a>setRemoteDescription</a></code> and <code><a>close</a></code>.
        These interactions are described in the relevant sections in this
        document and in [[!JSEP]]. The <a>ICE Agent</a> also provides
        indications to the user agent when the state of its internal
        representation of an <code><a>RTCIceTransport</a></code> changes, as
        described in <a href= "#rtcicetransport"></a>.</p>

        <h4>Constructor</h4>
        <p>When the <dfn id=
        "dom-peerconnection"><code>RTCPeerConnection()</code></dfn> constructor
        is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Let <var>connection</var> be a newly created
            <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If the <code>certificates</code> value in
            <var>configuration</var> is non-empty, check that
            the <code>expires</code> on each value is in the future. If a
            certificate has expired, <a>throw</a> an
            <code>InvalidAccessError</code>; otherwise, store the certificates.
            If no <code>certificates</code> value was specified, one or more
            new <code>RTCCertificate</code> instances are generated for use
            with this <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instance. This MAY happen
            asynchronously and the value of <code>certificates</code> remains
            undefined for the subsequent steps.</p>

            <code>"negotiate"</code>, and the user agent does not implement
            non-muxed RTCP, <a>throw</a> a <code>NotSupportedError</code>.</p>

            "RTCPeerConnection" class="methods">
              <dt><dfn><code>createOffer</code></dfn></dt>
              <dd>
                <p>The <code>createOffer</code> method generates a blob of SDP that contains
                an RFC 3264 offer with the supported configurations for the
                session, including descriptions of the local
                <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s attached to this
                <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, the codec/RTP/RTCP capabilities
                supported by this implementation, and parameters of the <a>ICE
                agent</a> and the DTLS connection. The <code>options</code>
                parameter may be supplied to provide additional control over
                the offer generated.</p>
                <p>If a system has limited resources (e.g. a finite number of
                decoders), <code>createOffer</code> needs to return an offer
                that reflects the current state of the system, so that
                <code>setLocalDescription</code> will succeed when it attempts
                to acquire those resources. The session descriptions MUST
                remain usable by <code>setLocalDescription</code> without
                causing an error until at least the end of the <a>fulfillment</a>
                callback of the returned promise.</p>
                <p>Creating the SDP MUST follow the appropriate process for
                generating an offer described in [[!JSEP]].
                As an offer, the generated SDP will contain the full set of
                codec/RTP/RTCP capabilities supported by the session (as
                opposed to an answer, which will include only a specific
                negotiated subset to use). In the event
                <code>createOffer</code> is called after the session is
                established, <code>createOffer</code> will generate an offer
                that is compatible with the current session, incorporating any
                changes that have been made to the session since the last
                complete offer-answer exchange, such as addition or removal of
                tracks. If no changes have been made, the offer will include
                the capabilities of the current local description as well as
                any additional capabilities that could be negotiated in an
                updated offer.</p>
                <p>The generated SDP will also contain the <a>ICE agent</a>'s
                <a data-link-for="RTCIceParameters">usernameFragment</a>,
                <a data-link-for="RTCIceParameters">password</a> and
                ICE options (as defined in [[!ICE]], Section 14) and may also contain
                any local candidates that have been gathered by the agent.</p>
                <p>The <code>certificates</code> value in <var>configuration</var>
                for the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> provides the
                certificates configured by the application for the
                <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.  These certificates,
                along with any default certificates are used to produce a set of
                certificate fingerprints. These certificate fingerprints are
                used in the construction of SDP and as input to requests for
                identity assertions.</p>
                <p>If the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> is configured to
                generate Identity assertions by calling
                <code><a>setIdentityProvider</a></code>, then the session description
                SHALL contain an appropriate assertion.</p>
                <p class="fingerprint">The process of generating an SDP exposes a
                subset of the media capabilities of the underlying system,
                which provides generally persistent cross-origin information on
                the device. It thus increases the fingerprinting surface of the
                application. In privacy-sensitive contexts, browsers can
                consider mitigations such as generating SDP matching only a
                common subset of the capabilities.</p>

                <p>The <code>createAnswer</code> method generates an [[!SDP]]
                answer with the supported configuration for the session that is
                compatible with the parameters in the remote configuration.
                Like <code>createOffer</code>, the returned blob of SDP contains
                descriptions of the local <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s
                attached to this <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, the
                codec/RTP/RTCP options negotiated for this session, and any
                candidates that have been gathered by the <a>ICE Agent</a>. The
                <code>options</code> parameter may be supplied to provide
                additional control over the generated answer.</p>
                <p>Like <code>createOffer</code>, the
                returned description SHOULD reflect the current state of the
                system. The session descriptions MUST remain usable by
                <code>setLocalDescription</code> without causing an error until
                at least the end of the <a>fulfillment</a> callback of the returned
                promise.</p>
                <p>As an answer, the generated SDP will contain a specific
                codec/RTP/RTCP configuration that, along with the corresponding offer,
                specifies how the media plane should be established. The
                generation of the SDP MUST follow the appropriate process for
                generating an answer described in [[!JSEP]].</p>
                <p>The generated SDP will also contain the <a>ICE agent</a>'s
                <a data-link-for="RTCIceParameters">usernameFragment</a>,
                <a data-link-for="RTCIceParameters">password</a> and
                ICE options (as defined in [[!ICE]], Section 14) and may also contain
                any local candidates that have been gathered by the agent.</p>
                <p>The <code>certificates</code> value in <var>configuration</var>
                for the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> provides the
                certificates configured by the application for the
                <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.  These certificates,
                along with any default certificates are used to produce a set of
                certificate fingerprints. These certificate fingerprints are
                used in the construction of SDP and as input to requests for
                identity assertions.</p>
                <p>An answer can be marked as provisional, as described in
                <span data-jsep="use-of-provisional-answer">[[!JSEP]]</span>,
                by setting the <code><a data-for=
                "RTCSessionDescription">type</a></code> to
                <code>"pranswer"</code>.</p>
                <p>If the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> is configured to
                generate Identity assertions by calling
                <code><a>setIdentityProvider</a></code>, then the session description SHALL
                contain an appropriate assertion.</p>
                <p>When the method is called, the user agent MUST run the
                following steps:</p>

      <h3>Error Handling</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>General Principles</h4>
        <p>All methods that return promises are governed by the standard error
        handling rules of promises. Methods that do not return promises may
        throw exceptions to indicate errors.</p>
        <p>Legacy-methods may only throw exceptions to indicate invalid state
        and other programming errors. For example, when a legacy-method is
        called when the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> is in an invalid
        state or a state in which that particular method is not allowed to be
        executed, it will throw an exception. In all other cases, legacy
        methods MUST provide an error object to the error callback.</p>

      <h3>Session Negotiation Model</h3>
      <p>Many changes to state of an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> will
      require communication with the remote side via the signaling channel, in
      order to have the desired effect. The app can be kept informed as to when
      it needs to do signaling, by listening to the
      <code>negotiationneeded</code> event. This event is fired according to
      the state of the connection's <dfn>negotiation-needed flag</dfn>,
      represented by a <a>[[\NegotiationNeeded]]</a> internal slot.</p>
      <section class="informative">
        <h4>Setting Negotiation-Needed</h4>
        <p>If an operation is performed on an
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> that requires signaling, the
        connection will be marked as needing negotiation. Examples of such
        operations include adding or stopping an
        <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>, or adding the first <code><a>
        RTCDataChannel</a></code>.</p>
        <p>Internal changes within the implementation can also result in the
        connection being marked as needing negotiation.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="informative">
        <h4>Clearing Negotiation-Needed</h4>
        <p>The negotiation-needed flag is cleared when an
        <code><a>RTCSessionDescription</a></code> of type "answer" <a href=
        "#set-description">is applied</a>, and the supplied description matches
        the state of the

        <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>s that currently exist on the
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>. Specifically, this means that all
        non-<a data-for="RTCRtpTransceiver">stopped</a> transceivers have an
        <a>associated</a> section in the local description with matching properties,
        and, if any data channels have been created, a data section exists in

        <h4>Updating the Negotiation-Needed flag</h4>
        <p>The process below occurs where referenced elsewhere in this document.
        It also may occur as a result of internal changes within the
        implementation that affect negotiation. If such changes occur, the user
        agent MUST queue a task to <a>update the negotiation-needed
        flag</a>.</p>

            <p>If <var>connection</var>'s <a>signaling state</a> is not

      <h2>Priority and QoS Model</h2>
      <p>Many applications have multiple media flows of the same data type and
      often some of the flows are more important than others. WebRTC uses the
      priority and Quality of Service (QoS) framework described in
      [[!RTCWEB-TRANSPORT]] and [[!TSVWG-RTCWEB-QOS]] to provide priority and
      DSCP marking for packets that will help provide QoS in some networking
      environments. The priority setting can be used to indicate the relative
      priority of various flows. The priority API allows the JavaScript
      applications to tell the browser whether a particular media flow is high,
      medium, low or of very low importance to the application by setting the
      <code>priority</code> property of
      <code><a>RTCRtpEncodingParameters</a></code> objects to one of the
      following values.</p>

      <p>The explicit certificate management functions provided here are

              <p>The <code>generateCertificate</code> function causes the

              [[!X509V3]] and corresponding private key. A handle to
              information is provided in the form of the
              <code>RTCCertificate</code> interface. The returned
              <code>RTCCertificate</code> can be used to control the
              certificate that is offered in the DTLS sessions established by
              <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.</p>
              <p>The <var>keygenAlgorithm</var> argument is used to control how
              the private key associated with the certificate is generated. The
              <var>keygenAlgorithm</var> argument uses the WebCrypto
              [[!WebCryptoAPI]] <a data-cite=
              "!WebCryptoAPI#dfn-AlgorithmIdentifier">
              <code>AlgorithmIdentifier</code></a> type. The

              <a data-cite=
              "!WebCryptoAPI#SubtleCrypto-method-generateKey">
              <code>window.crypto.subtle.generateKey</code></a>; that is, the

              <code>AlgorithmIdentifier</code>) MUST be an asymmetric algorithm
              that can be used to produce a signature.</p>
              <p>The certificate produced by this process also contains a
              signature. The validity of this signature is only relevant for
              compatibility reasons. Only the public key and the resulting
              certificate fingerprint are used by
              <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, but it is more likely that a
              certificate will be accepted if the certificate is well formed.
              The browser selects the algorithm used to sign the certificate; a
              browser SHOULD select SHA-256 [[!FIPS-180-4]] if a hash algorithm
              is needed.</p>
              <p>The resulting certificate MUST NOT include information that

    <h2>RTP Media API</h2>
    <p>The <dfn>RTP media API</dfn> lets a web application send and receive
    <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s over a peer-to-peer connection. Tracks, when
    added to an <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, result in signaling; when this
    signaling is forwarded to a remote peer, it causes corresponding tracks to
    be created on the remote side.</p>
    <p>When sending media, the sender may need to rescale or
    resample the media to meet various requirements including the
    envelope negotiated by SDP.</p>
    <p>Following the rules in <span data-jsep="imageattr">[[!JSEP]]</span>, the
    video MAY be downscaled in order to fit the SDP constraints. The media MUST
    NOT be upscaled to create fake data that did not occur in the input source,
    the media MUST NOT be cropped except as needed to satisfy constraints on
    pixel counts, and the aspect ratio MUST NOT be changed.</p>
    <p class="note">The WebRTC Working Group is seeking implementation 
    feedback on the need and timeline for a more complex handling of this 
    situation. Some possible designs have been discussed in <a 
    href="https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/1283">GitHub issue 
    1283</a>.</p>
    <p>When video is rescaled, for example for certain combinations
    of width or height and
    <code><a data-link-for="RTCRtpEncodingParameters">
    scaleResolutionDownBy</a></code> values, situations when the resulting width
    or height is not an integer may occur. In such situations the
    user agent MUST use the integer part of the result (
    https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#eqn-floor). What to transmit if the integer
    part of the scaled width or height is zero is implementation-specific.</p>
    <p>The actual encoding and transmission of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s
    is managed through objects called <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a></code>s.
    Similarly, the reception and decoding of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s is
    managed through objects called <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a></code>s. Each
    <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a></code> is associated with at most one track,
    and each track to be received is associated with exactly
    one <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a></code>.</p>
    <p>The encoding and transmission of each <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>
    SHOULD be made such that its characteristics (width, height and frameRate
    for video tracks; volume, sampleSize, sampleRate and channelCount for audio
    tracks) are to a reasonable degree retained by the track created on the
    remote side. There are situations when this does not apply, there may for
    example be resource constraints at either endpoint or in the network or
    there may be <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a></code> settings applied that
    instruct the implementation to act differently.</p>
    <p>
      An <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object contains a <dfn id=
      "transceivers-set" data-lt="set of transceivers">set of
      <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>s</dfn>, representing the paired
      senders and receivers with some shared state. This set is initialized to
      the empty set when the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object is
      created. <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a></code>s and
      <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a></code>s are always created at the same time
      as an <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>, which they will remain
      attached to for their lifetime.
      <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>s are created implicitly when the
      application attaches a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> to an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> via the <code>addTrack</code>
      method, or explicitly when the application uses the
      <code>addTransceiver</code> method. They are also created when a remote
      description is applied that includes a new media description.
      Additionally, when a remote description is applied that indicates the
      remote endpoint has media to send, the relevant
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> and <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a></code> are
      surfaced to the application via the <code><a>track</a></code> event.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>There are several ways to initiate the sending of a
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> over a peer-to-peer connection.
      One way is to use the <code>addTrack</code> method on the
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>. Another way is to use
      the <code>replaceTrack</code> method on an existing
      <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a></code>. Yet another way is to
      create a new <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a></code> via the
      <code>addTransceiver</code> method (with or without a
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> argument). While
      <code>addTrack</code> checks if the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>
      given as an argument is already being sent to avoid sending
      the same <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> twice, the other ways
      do not, allowing the same <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> (possibly
      using different <code><a>RTCRtpParameters</a></code> with different
      <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a></code>s) to be sent several times
      simultaneously. Doing this implies that at the receiving end of
      the peer-to-peer connection there are several
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s with an identical
      <code>id</code>.</p>

      a given contributing source (CSRC) or synchronization source (SSRC),

      packet that the source contributed to was played out. The browser MUST
      keep information from RTP packets received in the previous 10 seconds.
      When the first audio frame contained in an RTP packet is delivered to the
      <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a></code>'s <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>

      <code><a>RTCRtpContributingSource</a></code> and
      <code><a>RTCRtpSynchronizationSource</a></code> objects based on the
      contents of the packet. The
      <code><a>RTCRtpSynchronizationSource</a></code> object corresponding to
      the SSRC identifier is updated each time, and if the RTP packet contains
      CSRC identifiers, then the <code><a>RTCRtpContributingSource</a></code>

              <p>The <code>setCodecPreferences</code> method overrides the

              <code>createOffer</code> or <code>createAnswer</code>, the

              specified in the <var>codecs</var> argument, for the media

              Note that calls to <code>createAnswer</code> will use only the

              offer.</p>
              <p>This method allows applications to disable the negotiation of

              sending.</p>
              <p>Codec preferences remain in effect for all calls to
              <code>createOffer</code> and <code>createAnswer</code> that
              include this <code>RTCRtpTransceiver</code> until this method is
              called again. Setting <var>codecs</var> to an empty sequence
              resets codec preferences to any default value.</p>
              <p>The <code>codecs</code> sequence passed into
              <code>setCodecPreferences</code> can only contain codecs that are
              returned by <code>RTCRtpSender.getCapabilities(kind)</code> or
              <code>RTCRtpReceiver.getCapabilities(kind)</code>, where
              <code>kind</code> is the kind of the
              <code>RTCRtpTransceiver</code> on which the method is called.
              Additionally, the <code>RTCRtpCodecParameters</code> dictionary
              members cannot be modified. If <code>codecs</code> does not
              fulfill these requirements, the user agent MUST <a>throw</a> an

      <h3><dfn>RTCDtlsTransport</dfn> Interface</h3>
      <p>The <code><a>RTCDtlsTransport</a></code> interface allows an
      application access to information about the Datagram Transport Layer
      Security (DTLS) transport over which RTP and RTCP packets are sent and
      received by <code><a>RTCRtpSender</a></code> and
      <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a></code> objects, as well other data such as
      SCTP packets sent and received by data channels. In particular, DTLS adds
      security to an underlying transport, and the
      <code>RTCDtlsTransport</code> interface allows access to information
      about the underlying transport and the security added.
      <code><a>RTCDtlsTransport</a></code> objects are constructed as a result
      of calls to <code>setLocalDescription()</code> and
      <code>setRemoteDescription()</code>. Each
      <code><a>RTCDtlsTransport</a></code> object represents the DTLS transport
      layer for the RTP or RTCP <code><a data-link-for="RTCIceTransport">component</a></code>
      of a specific <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>, or a group of
      <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>s if such a group has been
      negotiated via [[!BUNDLE]].</p>

      <div class="note">A new DTLS association for an existing
      <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code> will be represented by an existing
      <code><a>RTCDtlsTransport</a></code> object, whose <code><a
      data-link-for="RTCDtlsTransport">state</a></code> will be updated accordingly,
      as opposed to being represented by a new object.</div>

      <p>An <code><a>RTCDtlsTransport</a></code> has a
      <dfn>[[\DtlsTransportState]]</dfn> internal slot initialized to <code>
      <a data-link-for="RTCDtlsTransportState">new</a></code>.</p>
      <p>When the underlying DTLS transport needs to update the state of the
      corresponding <code><a>RTCDtlsTransport</a></code> object, the user agent
      MUST queue a task that runs the following steps:</p>

      <h3><dfn>RTCIceTransport</dfn> Interface</h3>
      <p>The <code><a>RTCIceTransport</a></code> interface allows an
      application access to information about the ICE transport over which
      packets are sent and received. In particular, ICE manages peer-to-peer
      connections which involve state which the application may want to access.
      <code><a>RTCIceTransport</a></code> objects are constructed as a result
      of calls to <code>setLocalDescription()</code> and
      <code>setRemoteDescription()</code>. The underlying ICE state is managed
      by the <a>ICE agent</a>; as such, the state of an
      <code><a>RTCIceTransport</a></code> changes when the <a>ICE Agent</a>
      provides indications to the user agent as described below. Each
      <code><a>RTCIceTransport</a></code> object represents the ICE transport
      layer for the RTP or RTCP <code><a data-link-for="RTCIceTransport">component</a></code>
      of a specific <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>, or a group of
      <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>s if such a group has been
      negotiated via [[!BUNDLE]].</p>

      <div class="note">An ICE restart for an existing
      <code><a>RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code> will be represented by an existing
      <code><a>RTCIceTransport</a></code> object, whose <code><a
      data-link-for="RTCIceTransport">state</a></code> will be updated
      accordingly, as opposed to being represented by a new object.</div>

      <p>When the <a>ICE Agent</a> indicates that it began gathering a
      <a>generation</a> of candidates for an <code><a>RTCIceTransport</a></code>, the
      user agent MUST queue a task that runs the following steps:</p>

      <h3><dfn>RTCDataChannel</dfn></h3>
      <p>The <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> interface represents a
      bi-directional data channel between two peers. An
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> is created via a factory method on an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object. The messages sent between
      the browsers are described in [[!RTCWEB-DATA]] and
      [[!RTCWEB-DATA-PROTOCOL]].</p>
      <p>There are two ways to establish a connection with
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>. The first way is to simply create an
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> at one of the peers with the
      <code><a data-for="RTCDataChannelInit">negotiated</a></code>
      <code><a>RTCDataChannelInit</a></code> dictionary member unset or set to
      its default value false. This will announce the new channel in-band and
      trigger an <code><a>RTCDataChannelEvent</a></code> with the corresponding
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object at the other peer. The second
      way is to let the application negotiate the
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>. To do this, create an
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object with the <code><a data-for=
      "RTCDataChannelInit">negotiated</a></code>
      <code><a>RTCDataChannelInit</a></code> dictionary member set to true, and
      signal out-of-band (e.g. via a web server) to the other side that it
      SHOULD create a corresponding <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> with the
      <code><a data-for="RTCDataChannelInit">negotiated</a></code>
      <code><a>RTCDataChannelInit</a></code> dictionary member set to true and
      the same <code><a data-for="RTCDataChannel">id</a></code>. This will
      connect the two separately created <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>
      objects. The second way makes it possible to create channels with
      asymmetric properties and to create channels in a declarative way by
      specifying matching <code><a data-for=
      "RTCDataChannelInit">id</a></code>s.</p>
      <p>Each <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> has an associated
      <dfn data-lt="data transport">underlying data transport</dfn> that is
      used to transport actual data to the other peer. The transport properties
      of the <a>underlying data transport</a>, such as in order delivery
      settings and reliability mode, are configured by the peer as the channel
      is created. The properties of a channel cannot change after the channel
      has been created. The actual wire protocol between the peers is specified
      by the WebRTC DataChannel Protocol specification [[RTCWEB-DATA]].</p>
      <p>An <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> can be configured to operate in
      different reliability modes. A reliable channel ensures that the data is
      delivered at the other peer through retransmissions. An unreliable
      channel is configured to either limit the number of retransmissions (
      <code><a data-for="RTCDataChannelInit">maxRetransmits</a></code> ) or set
      a time during which transmissions (including retransmissions) are allowed
      ( <code><a data-for="RTCDataChannelInit">maxPacketLifeTime</a></code> ).
      These properties can not be used simultaneously and an attempt to do so
      will result in an error. Not setting any of these properties results in a
      reliable channel.</p>
      <p>An <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>, created with <code><a data-for=
      "RTCPeerConnection">createDataChannel</a></code> or dispatched via an
      <code><a>RTCDataChannelEvent</a></code>, MUST initially be in the
      <code>connecting</code> state. When the
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object's <a>underlying data
      transport</a> is ready, the user agent MUST <a>announce the
      <code>RTCDataChannel</code> as open</a>.</p>
      <p>When the user agent is to <dfn data-lt=
      "announce the rtcdatachannel as open" id=
      "announce-datachannel-open">announce an <code>RTCDataChannel</code> as
      open</dfn>, the user agent MUST queue a task to run the following
      steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>If the associated <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object's
          <a>[[\IsClosed]]</a> slot is <code>true</code>, abort these steps.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Let <var>channel</var> be the <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>
          object to be announced.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Set <var>channel</var>'s <a>[[\ReadyState]]</a> slot to
          <code>open</code>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Fire a simple event named <code><a>open</a></code> at
          <var>channel</var>.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>When an <a>underlying data transport</a> is to be announced (the other
      peer created a channel with <code><a data-for=
      "RTCDataChannelInit">negotiated</a></code> unset or set to false), the
      user agent of the peer that did not initiate the creation process MUST
      queue a task to run the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>If the associated <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object's
          <a>[[\IsClosed]]</a> slot is <code>true</code>, abort these steps.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Let <var>channel</var> be a newly created
          <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Let <var>configuration</var> be an information bundle received
          from the other peer as a part of the process to establish the
          <a>underlying data transport</a> described by the WebRTC DataChannel
          Protocol specification [[!RTCWEB-DATA-PROTOCOL]].</p>
        </li>

      </ol>
      <p>An <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object's <a>underlying data
      transport</a> may be torn down in a non-abrupt manner by running the
      <dfn id="data-transport-closing-procedure">closing procedure</dfn>. When
      that happens the user agent MUST, unless the procedure was initiated by
      the <code><a data-for="RTCDataChannel">close</a></code> method, queue a
      task that sets the object's <a>[[\ReadyState]]</a> slot to <code>closing</code>.
      This will eventually render the <a>data transport</a> <a>closed</a>.</p>
      <p>When an <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code> object's <a>underlying data

        <li>
          <p>Set <var>channel</var>'s <a>[[\ReadyState]]</a> slot to

        </li>

          <p>If the <a data-lt="data transport">transport</a> was closed

          <var>channel</var>.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>In some cases, the user agent may be unable to create an
      <code><a>RTCDataChannel</a></code>'s <a>underlying data transport</a>.
      For example, the data channel's <code><a data-for=
      "RTCDataChannel">id</a></code> may be outside the range negotiated by the
      [[!RTCWEB-DATA]] implementations in the SCTP handshake. When the user

              "dom-RTCDTMFSender-insertDTMF"><code>insertDTMF</code></dfn>
              method is used to send DTMF tones.</p>
              <p>The tones parameter is treated as a series of characters. The
              characters 0 through 9, A through D, #, and * generate the
              associated DTMF tones. The characters a to d MUST be normalized
              to uppercase on entry and are equivalent to A to D. As noted in
              [[RTCWEB-AUDIO]] Section 3, support for the characters 0 through
              9, A through D, #, and * are required. The character ',' MUST be
              supported, and indicates a delay of 2 seconds before processing
              the next character in the tones parameter. All other characters
              (and only those other characters) MUST be considered <dfn id=
              "dtmf-unrecognized">unrecognized</dfn>.</p>
              <p>The duration parameter indicates the duration in ms to use for
              each character passed in the tones parameters. The duration
              cannot be more than 6000 ms or less than 40 ms. The default
              duration is 100 ms for each tone.</p>
              <p>The interToneGap parameter indicates the gap between tones in
              ms. The user agent clamps it to at least 30 ms and at most
              6000 ms. The default value is 70 ms.</p>
              <p>The browser MAY increase the duration and interToneGap times
              to cause the times that DTMF start and stop to align with the
              boundaries of RTP packets but it MUST not increase either of them
              by more than the duration of a single RTP audio packet.</p>
              <p>When the <code><a>insertDTMF()</a></code> method is invoked,
              the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The basic statistics model is that the browser maintains a set of
      statistics referenced by a <dfn id="stats-selector">selector</dfn>. The
      selector may, for example, be a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>. For a
      track to be a valid selector, it MUST be a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>
      that is sent or received by the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>
      object on which the stats request was issued. The calling Web application
      provides the selector to the <code><a data-for=
      "RTCPeerConnection">getStats()</a></code> method and the browser emits
      (in the JavaScript) a set of statistics that are relevant to the selector,
      according to the <a>stats selection algorithm</a>. Note that that
      algorithm takes the sender or receiver of a selector.</p>
      <p>The statistics returned are designed in such a way that repeated
      queries can be linked by the <code><a>RTCStats</a></code> <a data-for=
      "RTCStats">id</a> dictionary member. Thus, a Web application can make
      measurements over a given time period by requesting measurements at the
      beginning and end of that period.</p>

      <h3>RTCPeerConnection Interface Extensions</h3>

      <h3><dfn>RTCStatsReport</dfn> Object</h3>
      <p>The <code><a data-for="RTCPeerConnection">getStats()</a></code> method
      delivers a successful result in the form of an
      <code><a>RTCStatsReport</a></code> object. An
      <code><a>RTCStatsReport</a></code> object is a map between strings that
      identify the inspected objects (<a data-for=
      "RTCStats"><code>id</code></a> attribute in <code>RTCStats</code>
      instances), and their corresponding <code><a>RTCStats</a></code>-derived
      dictionaries.</p>
      <p>An <code><a>RTCStatsReport</a></code> may be composed of several
      <code><a>RTCStats</a></code>-derived dictionaries, each reporting stats
      for one underlying object that the implementation thinks is relevant for
      the <a>selector</a>. One achieves the total for the <a>selector</a> by
      summing over all the stats of a certain type; for instance, if an
      <code>RTCRtpSender</code> uses multiple SSRCs to carry its track over the
      network, the <code><a>RTCStatsReport</a></code> may contain one
      <code>RTCStats</code>-derived dictionary per SSRC (which can be
      distinguished by the value of the "ssrc" stats attribute).</p>
      <div>
        <pre class="idl">[Exposed=Window] interface RTCStatsReport {
    readonly maplike&lt;DOMString, object&gt;;
};</pre>
        <p>This interface has "entries", "forEach", "get", "has", "keys",
        "values", @@iterator methods and a "size" getter brought by
        <code>readonly maplike</code>.</p>
        <p>Use these to retrieve the various dictionaries descended from
        <code><a>RTCStats</a></code> that this stats report is composed of. The
        set of supported property names [[!WEBIDL-1]] is defined as the ids of
        all the <code><a>RTCStats</a></code>-derived dictionaries that have
        been generated for this stats report.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3><dfn>RTCStats</dfn> Dictionary</h3>
      <p>An <code>RTCStats</code> dictionary represents the stats
      gathered by inspecting a specific object relevant to a <a>selector</a>.
      The <code>RTCStats</code> dictionary is a base type that specifies
      as set of default attributes, such as <a data-for=
      "RTCStats">timestamp</a> and <a data-for="RTCStats">type</a>. Specific
      stats are added by extending the <code>RTCStats</code>
      dictionary.</p>
      <p>Note that while stats names are standardized, any given implementation
      may be using experimental values or values not yet known to the Web
      application. Thus, applications MUST be prepared to deal with unknown
      stats.</p>
      <p>Statistics need to be synchronized with each other in order to yield
      reasonable values in computation; for instance, if "bytesSent" and
      "packetsSent" are both reported, they both need to be reported over the
      same interval, so that "average packet size" can be computed as "bytes /
      packets" - if the intervals are different, this will yield errors. Thus
      implementations MUST return synchronized values for all stats in an
      <code><a>RTCStats</a></code>-derived dictionary.</p>
      <div>
        <pre class="idl">dictionary RTCStats {

    // compare the elements from the current report with the baseline
    for (let now of currentReport.values()) {
      if (now.type != 'outbound-rtp') continue;

      // get the corresponding stats from the baseline report

      <h3>Identity Provider Interaction</h3>
      <p>WebRTC offers and answers (and hence the channels established by
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> objects) can be authenticated by
      using a web-based Identity Provider (IdP). The idea is that the entity
      sending an offer or answer acts as the Authenticating Party (AP) and
      obtains an identity assertion from the IdP which it attaches to the
      session description. The consumer of the session description (i.e., the
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> on which
      <code>setRemoteDescription</code> is called) acts as the Relying Party
      (RP) and verifies the assertion.</p>
      <p>The interaction with the IdP is designed to decouple the browser from
      any particular identity provider; the browser need only know how to load
      the IdP's JavaScript, the location of which is determined by the IdP's
      identity, and the generic interface to generating and validating
      assertions. The IdP provides whatever logic is necessary to bridge the
      generic protocol to the IdP's specific requirements. Thus, a single
      browser can support any number of identity protocols, including being
      forward compatible with IdPs which did not exist at the time the browser
      was written.</p>
      <section>
        <h4 id="sec.identity-proxy-communications">Identity Provider
        Selection</h4>
        <p>An IdP is used to generate an identity assertion as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>If the <code>setIdentityProvider()</code> method has been called,
          the IdP provided shall be used.</li>
          <li>If the <code>setIdentityProvider()</code> method has not been
          called, then the user agent MAY use an IdP configured into the
          browser.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In order to verify assertions, the IdP domain name and protocol are
        taken from the <code>domain</code> and <code>protocol</code> fields of
        the identity assertion.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4 id="sec.create-identity-proxy">Instantiating an IdP Proxy</h4>
        <p>In order to communicate with the IdP, the user agent loads the IdP
        JavaScript from the IdP. The URI for the IdP script is a well-known URI
        formed from the <q>domain</q> and <q>protocol</q> fields, as specified
        in [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].</p>
        <p>The IdP MAY generate an HTTP redirect to another "https" origin, the
        browser MUST treat a redirect to any other scheme as a fatal error.</p>
        <p>The user agent instantiates an isolated interpreted context, a
        JavaScript <dfn data-cite="!ECMASCRIPT-6.0#sec-code-realms">

          <p>An environment that mimics the identity provider realm can be
          provided by any script. However, only scripts running in the origin
          of the IdP are able to generate an identical environment. Other
          origins can load and run the IdP proxy code, but they will be unable
          to replicate data that is unique to the origin of the IdP.</p>
          <p>This means that it is critical that an IdP use data that is
          restricted to its own origin when generating identity assertions.
          Otherwise, another origin could load the IdP script and use it to
          impersonate users.</p>
          <p>The data that the IdP script uses could be stored on the client
          (for example, in [[INDEXEDDB]]) or loaded from
          servers. Data that is acquired from a server SHOULD require
          credentials and be protected from cross-origin access.</p>
          <p>There is no risk to the integrity of identity assertions if an IdP
          validates an identity assertion without using origin-private
          data.</p>

      <h3 id="sec.identity-proxy-assertion-request">Requesting Identity
      Assertions</h3>
      <p>The identity assertion request process is triggered by a call to
      <code>createOffer</code>, <code>createAnswer</code>, or
      <code>getIdentityAssertion</code>. When these calls are invoked and an
      identity provider has been set, the following steps are executed:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instantiates an IdP as
          described in <a href="#sec.identity-proxy-communications">Identity
          Provider Selection</a> and <a href="#sec.register-idp">Registering an
          IdP Proxy</a>. If the IdP cannot be loaded, instantiated, or the IdP
          proxy is not registered, this process fails.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> was not constructed with a set
          of certificates, and one has not yet been generated, wait
          for it to be generated.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> invokes the <code><a data-for=
          "RTCIdentityProvider">generateAssertion</a></code> method on the
          <code><a>RTCIdentityProvider</a></code> methods registered by the
          IdP.</p>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> generates the
          <var>contents</var> parameter to this method as described in
          [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]]. The value of <var>contents</var> includes
          the fingerprint of the certificate that was selected or generated
          during the construction of the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>. The
          <var>origin</var> parameter contains the origin of the script that
          calls the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> method that triggers this
          behavior. The <var>usernameHint</var> value is the same value that is
          provided to <code>setIdentityProvider</code>, if any such value
          was provided.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The IdP proxy returns a Promise to the
          <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>. The IdP proxy is expected to generate
          the identity assertion asynchronously.</p>
          <p>If the user has been authenticated by the IdP, and the IdP is able
          to generate an identity assertion, the IdP <a>resolves</a> the promise with
          an identity assertion in the form of an
          <code><a>RTCIdentityAssertionResult</a></code>.</p>
          <p>This step depends entirely on the IdP. The methods by which an IdP
          authenticates users or generates assertions is not specified, though
          they could involve interacting with the IdP server or other
          servers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If the IdP proxy produces an error or returns a promise that does
          not <a>resolve</a> to a valid
          <code><a>RTCIdentityAssertionResult</a></code> (see <a href=
          "#sec.idp-error-handling"></a>), then assertion generation fails.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> MAY store the identity
          assertion for use with future offers or answers. If a fresh identity
          assertion is needed for any reason, applications can create a new
          <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If the identity request was triggered by a
          <code>createOffer()</code> or <code>createAnswer()</code>, then the
          assertion is converted to a JSON string, base64-encoded and inserted
          into an <code>a=identity</code> attribute in the session
          description.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>If assertion generation fails, then the promise for the corresponding
      function call is <a>rejected</a> with a newly <a data-link-for="exception"
      data-lt="create">created</a> <code>OperationError</code>.</p>
      <section>
        <h4 id="sec.idp-loginneeded">User Login Procedure</h4>
        <p>An IdP MAY reject an attempt to generate an identity assertion if it
        is unable to verify that a user is authenticated. This might be due to
        the IdP not having the necessary authentication information available
        to it (such as cookies).</p>
        <p>Rejecting the promise returned by <code><a data-for=
        "RTCIdentityProvider">generateAssertion</a></code> will cause the error
        to propagate to the application. Login errors are indicated by <a>rejecting</a>
        the promise with an <code><a>RTCError</a></code> with <code>errorDetail</code>
        set to "idp-need-login".</p>
        <p>The URL to login at will be passed to the application in the
        <code>idpLoginUrl</code> attribute of the
        <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>.</p>
        <p>An application can load the login URL in an IFRAME or popup window;
        the resulting page then SHOULD provide the user with an opportunity to
        enter any information necessary to complete the authorization
        process.</p>
        <p>Once the authorization process is complete, the page loaded in the
        IFRAME or popup sends a message using <var>postMessage</var>
        [[!webmessaging]] to the page that loaded it (through the <var><a data-cite=
        "!HTML51/browsers.html#opener">
        window.opener</a></var> attribute for popups, or through <var><a data-cite=
        "!HTML51/browsers.html#dom-window-parent">
        window.parent</a></var> for pages loaded in an IFRAME). The message

      <p>Identity assertion validation happens when <code><a data-for=
      "RTCPeerConnection">setRemoteDescription</a></code> is invoked on
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>. The process runs asynchronously,
      meaning that validation of an identity assertion might not block the
      completion of <code>setRemoteDescription</code>.</p>
      <p>The identity assertion request process involves the following
      asynchronous steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> awaits any prior identity
          validation. Only one identity validation can run at a time for an
          <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>. This can happen because the
          resolution of <code>setRemoteDescription</code> is not blocked by
          identity validation unless there is a <a>target peer
          identity</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> loads the identity assertion
          from the session description and decodes the base64 value, then
          parses the resulting JSON. The <var>idp</var> parameter of the
          resulting dictionary contains a <var>domain</var> and an optional
          <var>protocol</var> value that identifies the IdP, as described in
          [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If the identity assertion is malformed, or if <var>protocol</var>
          includes the character <code>'/'</code> or <code>'\'</code>,
          this process fails.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instantiates the identified IdP
          as described in <a href="#sec.identity-proxy-communications"></a> and
          <a href="#sec.register-idp"></a>. If the IdP cannot be loaded,
          instantiated or the IdP proxy is not registered, this process
          fails.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> invokes the <code><a data-for=
          "RTCIdentityProvider">validateAssertion</a></code> method registered
          by the IdP.</p>
          <p>The <var>assertion</var> parameter is taken from the decoded
          identity assertion. The <var>origin</var> parameter contains the
          origin of the script that calls the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>
          method that triggers this behavior.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The IdP proxy returns a promise and performs the validation
          process asynchronously.</p>
          <p>The IdP proxy verifies the identity assertion using whatever means
          necessary. Depending on the authentication protocol this could
          involve interacting with the IdP server.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If the IdP proxy produces an error or returns a promise that does
          not <a>resolve</a> to a valid
          <code><a>RTCIdentityValidationResult</a></code> (see <a href=
          "#sec.idp-error-handling"></a>), then identity validation fails.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Once the assertion is successfully verified, the IdP proxy
          <a>resolves</a> the promise with an
          <code><a>RTCIdentityValidationResult</a></code> containing the
          validated identity and the original contents that are the payload of
          the assertion.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> decodes the <code><a data-for=
          "RTCIdentityValidationResult">contents</a></code> and validates that
          it contains a fingerprint value for every <code>a=fingerprint</code>
          attribute in the session description. This ensures that the
          certificate used by the remote peer for communications is covered by
          the identity assertion.</p>
          <p class="note">A <a>user agent</a> is required to fail to
          communicate with peers that offer a certificate that doesn't match an
          <code>a=fingerprint</code> line in the negotiated session
          description.</p>
          <p class="note">The user agent decodes <a data-for=
          "RTCIdentityValidationResult"><code>contents</code></a> using
          the format described in [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]]. However the IdP
          MUST treat <code>contents</code> as opaque and return the same string
          to allow for future extensions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> validates that the domain
          portion of the identity matches the domain of the IdP as described in
          [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]]. If this check fails then the identity
          validation fails.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> resolves the <code><a data-for=
          "RTCPeerConnection">peerIdentity</a></code> attribute with a new
          instance of <code>RTCIdentityAssertion</code> that includes the IdP
          domain and peer identity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <a>user agent</a> MAY display identity information to a user
          in its UI. Any user identity information that is displayed in this
          fashion MUST use a mechanism that cannot be spoofed by content.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>If identity validation fails, the <code><a data-for=
      "RTCPeerConnection">peerIdentity</a></code> promise is <a>rejected</a> with a
      newly <a data-link-for="exception" data-lt="create">created</a>
      <code>OperationError</code>.</p>
      <p>If identity validation fails and there is a <a>target peer
      identity</a> for the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, the promise returned
      by <code>setRemoteDescription</code> MUST be <a>rejected</a> with the same
      <code>DOMException</code>.</p>
      <p>If identity validation fails and there is no a <a>target peer
      identity</a>, the value of the <code><a data-for=
      "RTCPeerConnection">peerIdentity</a></code> MUST be set to a new,
      unresolved promise instance. This permits the use of renegotiation (or a
      subsequent answer, if the session description was a provisional answer)
      to resolve or reject the identity.</p>

      <h2 id="sec.idp-error-handling">IdP Error Handling</h2>
      <p>Errors in IdP processing will - in most cases - result in the failure
      of the procedure that invoked the IdP proxy. This will result in the
      <a>rejection</a> of the promise returned by <code><a data-for=
      "RTCPeerConnection">getIdentityAssertion</a></code>, <code><a data-for=
      "RTCPeerConnection">createOffer</a></code>, or <code><a data-for=
      "RTCPeerConnection">createAnswer</a></code>. An IdP proxy error causes a
      <code><a data-for="RTCPeerConnection">setRemoteDescription</a></code>
      promise to be <a>rejected</a> if there is a <a>target peer identity</a>; IdP
      errors in calls to <code><a data-for=
      "RTCPeerConnection">setRemoteDescription</a></code> where there is no
      <a>target peer identity</a> cause the <code><a data-for=
      "RTCPeerConnection">peerIdentity</a></code> promise to be <a>rejected</a>
      instead.</p>
      <p>If an error occurs these promises are <a>rejected</a> with an
      <code><a>RTCError</a></code> if an error occurs in interacting with the IdP
      proxy. The following scenarios result in errors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>An <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> might be configured with an
        identity provider, but loading of the IdP URI fails. Any procedure that
        attempts to invoke such an identity provider and cannot load the
        URI fails with an <code><a>RTCError</a></code> with <code>errorDetail</code>
        set to "idp-load-failure" and the httpRequestStatusCode attribute of
        the error set to the HTTP status code of the response.</p></li>
        <li><p>If the IdP loads fails due to the TLS certificate used for the
        HTTPS connection not being trusted, it fails with an
        <code><a>RTCError</a></code> with <code>errorDetail</code> set to
       "idp-tls-failure". This typically happens when the IdP uses
        certificate pinning and an intermediary such as an enterprise
        firewall has intercepted the TLS connection.</p></li>
        <li><p>If the script loaded from the identity provider is
        not valid JavaScript or does not implement the correct interfaces,
        it causes an IdP failure with an <code><a>RTCError</a></code> with
        <code>errorDetail</code> set to "idp-bad-script-failure".</p></li>
        <li><p>An apparently valid identity provider might fail in several
        ways.
        <!-- 1 remove this comment later. ONE -->
        If the IdP token has expired, then the IdP MUST fail with an
        <code><a>RTCError</a></code> with <code>errorDetail</code> set to
        "idp-token-expired".
        <!-- 2 remove this comment later. TWO -->
        If the IdP token is not valid, then the IdP MUST fail with an
        <code><a>RTCError</a></code> with <code>errorDetail</code> set to
        "idp-token-invalid".
        <!-- 3 remove this comment later. THREE -->
        If an identity provider throws an exception or returns a promise
        that is ultimately <a>rejected</a>, then the procedure that depends on the IdP
        MUST also fail. These types of errors will cause an IdP failure with an
        <code><a>RTCError</a></code> with <code>errorDetail</code> set to
        "idp-execution-failure".</p></li>
        <li><p>The <a>user agent</a> SHOULD limit the time that it allows for
        an IdP to 15 seconds. This includes both the loading of the <a href=
        "#sec.identity-proxy-communications">IdP proxy</a> and the identity
        assertion generation or validation. Failure to do so potentially causes
        the corresponding operation to take an indefinite amount of time. This
        timer can be cancelled when the IdP proxy produces a
        response. Expiration of this timer cases an IdP failure with an
        <code><a>RTCError</a></code> with <code>errorDetail</code> set to
        "idp-timeout".</p></li>
        <li><p>If the identity provider requires the user to login, the
        operation will fail <code><a>RTCError</a></code> with <code>errorDetail</code>
        set to "idp-need-login" and the <code>idpLoginUrl</code> attribute of
        the error set to the URL that can be used to login.</p></li>
        <li><p>Even when the IdP proxy produces a positive result, the
        procedure that uses this information might still fail. Additional
        validation of an <a>RTCIdentityValidationResult</a> value is still
        necessary. The procedure for <a
        href="#sec.identity-verify-assertion">validation of identity
        assertions</a> describes additional steps that are required to
        successfully validate the output of the IdP proxy.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Any error generated by the IdP MAY provide additional
      information in the <code>idpErrorInfo</code> attribute. The
      information in this string is defined by the IdP in use.</p>

      <h3>Identity Examples</h3>
      <p>The identity system is designed so that applications need not take any
      special action in order for users to generate and verify identity
      assertions; if a user has configured an IdP into their browser, then the
      browser will automatically request/generate assertions and the other side
      will automatically verify them and display the results. However,
      applications may wish to exercise tighter control over the identity
      system as shown by the following examples.</p>
      <div>

    <h2>Media Stream API Extensions for Network Use</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> interface, as defined in the
      [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] specification, typically represents a stream of data of
      audio or video. One or more <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s can be
      collected in a <code>MediaStream</code> (strictly speaking, a
      <code>MediaStream</code> as defined in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] may contain zero
      or more <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> objects).</p>
      <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> may be extended to represent a media
      flow that either comes from or is sent to a remote peer (and not just the
      local camera, for instance). The extensions required to enable this
      capability on the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> object will be described
      in this section. How the media is transmitted to the peer is described in
      [[!RTCWEB-RTP]], [[!RTCWEB-AUDIO]], and [[!RTCWEB-TRANSPORT]].</p>
      <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> sent to another peer will appear as
      one and only one <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> to the recipient. A peer
      is defined as a user agent that supports this specification. In addition,
      the sending side application can indicate what <code>MediaStream</code>
      object(s) the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is member of. The
      corresponding <code>MediaStream</code> object(s) on the receiver side
      will be created (if not already present) and populated accordingly.</p>
      <p>As also described earlier in this document, the objects
      <code>RTCRtpSender</code> and <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code> can be used by
      the application to get more fine grained control over the transmission
      and reception of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s.</p>
      <p>Channels are the smallest unit considered in the
      <code>MediaStream</code> specification. Channels are intended to be
      encoded together for transmission as, for instance, an RTP payload type.
      All of the channels that a codec needs to encode jointly MUST be in the
      same <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> and the codecs SHOULD be able to
      encode, or discard, all the channels in the track.</p>
      <p>The concepts of an input and output to a given
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> apply in the case of
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> objects transmitted over the network as
      well. A <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> created by an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object (as described previously in
      this document) will take as input the data received from a remote peer.
      Similarly, a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> from a local source, for
      instance a camera via [[!GETUSERMEDIA]], will have an output that
      represents what is transmitted to a remote peer if the object is used
      with an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> object.</p>
      <p>The concept of duplicating <code>MediaStream</code> and
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> objects as described in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]]
      is also applicable here. This feature can be used, for instance, in a
      video-conferencing scenario to display the local video from the user's
      camera and microphone in a local monitor, while only transmitting the
      audio to the remote peer (e.g. in response to the user using a "video
      mute" feature). Combining different <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> objects
      into new <code>MediaStream</code> objects is useful in certain
      situations.</p>
      <p class="note">In this document, we only specify aspects of the
      following objects that are relevant when used along with an
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>. Please refer to the original
      definitions of the objects in the [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] document for general
      information on using <code>MediaStream</code> and
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>.</p>

      <h3>MediaStream</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>id</h4>
        <p>The <code><a data-cite=
        "!GETUSERMEDIA#dom-mediastream-id">id</a></code>
        attribute specified in <code>MediaStream</code> returns an id that is
        unique to this stream, so that streams can be recognized at the remote
        end of the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> API.</p>
        <p>When a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> is created to represent a
        stream obtained from a remote peer, the <code><a data-cite=
        "!GETUSERMEDIA#dom-mediastream-id">id</a></code>
        attribute is initialized from information provided by the remote
        source.</p>
        <p class="note">The id of a <code><a>MediaStream</a></code> object is
        unique to the source of the stream, but that does not mean it is not
        possible to end up with duplicates. For example, the tracks of a
        locally generated stream could be sent from one user agent to a remote
        peer using <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> and then sent back to
        the original user agent in the same manner, in which case the original
        user agent will have multiple streams with the same id (the
        locally-generated one and the one received from the remote peer).</p>

      <h3>MediaStreamTrack</h3>
      <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> object's reference to its
      <code>MediaStream</code> in the non-local media source case (an RTP
      source, as is the case for <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s received over
      an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> ) is always strong.</p>
      <p>When an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> receives data on an RTP
      source for the first time, it MUST <a>update the muted state</a> of the
      corresponding <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> with the value
      <code>false</code>.</p>
      <p>When one of the SSRCs for RTP source media streams received
      by an <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> is removed (either
      due to reception of a BYE or via timeout), it MUST <a>update
      the muted state</a> of the corresponding
      <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> with the value
      <code>true</code>. If and when packets are received again,
      the <a data-lt="update the muted state">muted state MUST be
      updated</a> with the value <code>false</code>.</p>
      <p>The procedure <dfn data-lt="update the muted state" id=
      "update-track-muted">update a track's muted state</dfn> is specified in
      [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].</p>
      <p>When a <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> track produced by
        an <code><a>RTCRtpReceiver</a></code> <var>receiver</var> has
        <code>ended</code> [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] (such as via a call to
        <code><var>receiver</var>.track.stop</code>), the user agent MAY
        choose to free resources allocated for the incoming stream, by
        for instance turning off the decoder of <var>receiver</var>.</p>
      <section>
        <h4>MediaTrackSupportedConstraints, MediaTrackCapabilities,
        MediaTrackConstraints and MediaTrackSettings</h4>
        <p>The basics of <code>MediaTrackSupportedConstraints</code>,
        <code>MediaTrackCapabilites</code>, <code>MediaTrackConstraints</code>
        and <code>MediaTrackSettings</code> is outlined in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].
        However, the <code>MediaTrackSettings</code> for a
        <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> sourced by an
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> will only be populated with
        members to the extent that data is supplied by means of the remote
        <code><a>RTCSessionDescription</a></code> applied via
        <code>setRemoteDescription</code> and the actual RTP data. This means
        that certain members, such as <code>facingMode</code>,
        <code>echoCancellation</code>, <code>latency</code>,
        <code>deviceId</code> and <code>groupId</code>, will always be
        missing.</p>

      <h3>Isolated Media Streams</h3>
      <p>A MediaStream acquired using <code>getUserMedia()</code> is, by
      default, accessible to an application. This means that the application is
      able to access the contents of tracks, modify their content, and send
      that media to any peer it chooses.</p>
      <p>WebRTC supports calling scenarios where media is sent to a
      specifically identified peer, without the contents of media streams being
      accessible to applications. This is enabled by use of the
      <code>peerIdentity</code> parameter to <code>getUserMedia()</code>.</p>
      <p>An application willingly relinquishes access to media by including a
      <code>peerIdentity</code> parameter in the
      <code>MediaStreamConstraints</code>. This attribute is set to a
      <code>DOMString</code> containing the identity of a specific peer.</p>
      <p>The <code>MediaStreamConstraints</code> dictionary is expanded to
      include the <code>peerIdentity</code> parameter.</p>
      <div>
        <pre class="idl">partial dictionary MediaStreamConstraints {
             DOMString peerIdentity;
};</pre>

            "idlMemberType"><a>DOMString</a></span></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>If set, <code>peerIdentity</code> isolates media from the
              application. Media can only be sent to the identified peer.</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </section>
      </div>
      <p>A user that is prompted to provide consent for access to a camera or
      microphone can be shown the value of the <code>peerIdentity</code>
      parameter, so that they can be informed that the consent is more narrowly
      restricted.</p>
      <p>When the <code><dfn>peerIdentity</dfn></code> option is supplied to
      <code>getUserMedia()</code>, all of the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s in
      the resulting <code>MediaStream</code> are isolated so that content is
      not accessible to any application. Isolated
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s can be used for two purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Displayed in an appropriate media tag (e.g., a video or audio
          element). The browser MUST ensure that content is inaccessible to the
          application by ensuring that the resulting content is given the same
          protections as content that is <a data-cite=
          "!fetch#concept-cors-check">
          CORS cross-origin</a>, as described in the relevant <a data-cite=
          "!HTML51/semantics-embedded-content.html#security-and-privacy-considerations">

          restrictions in <a href="#isolated-pc">isolated streams and

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> that is added to another
      <code>MediaStream</code> remains isolated. When an isolated
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is added to a <code>MediaStream</code> with
      a different peerIdentity, the <code>MediaStream</code> gets a combination
      of isolation restrictions. A <code>MediaStream</code> containing
      <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> instances with mixed isolation properties
      can be displayed, but cannot be sent using
      <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>.</p>
      <p>Any <code>peerIdentity</code> property MUST be retained on cloned
      copies of <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s.</p>

        <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> with a <var>peerIdentity</var>
        option set can be added to any <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>.
        However, the content of an isolated track MUST NOT be transmitted
        unless all of the following constraints are met:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> from a stream acquired using the
            <var>peerIdentity</var> option can be transmitted if the

            "#sec.identity-verify-assertion">validated the identity</a> of the
            peer AND that identity is the same identity that was used in the
            <var>peerIdentity</var> option associated with the track. That is,
            the <code>name</code> attribute of the <code>peerIdentity</code>
            attribute of the <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> instance
            MUST match the value of the <code>peerIdentity</code> option passed
            to <code>getUserMedia()</code>.</p>
            <p>Rules for matching identity are described in
            [[!RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The peer has indicated that it will respect the isolation
            properties of streams. That is, a DTLS connection with a promise to
            respect stream confidentiality, as defined in [[!RTCWEB-ALPN]] has
            been established.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Failing to meet these conditions means that no media can be sent for
        the affected <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>. Video MUST be replaced by
        black frames, audio MUST be replaced by silence, and equivalently
        information-free content MUST be provided for other media types.</p>
        <p>Remotely sourced <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s MUST be isolated if
        they are received over a DTLS connection that has been negotiated with
        track isolation. This protects isolated media from the application in
        the receiving browser. These tracks MUST only be displayed to a user
        using the appropriate media element (e.g., &lt;video&gt; or
        &lt;audio&gt;).</p>
        <p>Any <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> that has the
        <var>peerIdentity</var> option set causes all tracks sent using the

        receiving peer. All DTLS connections created for an
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> with isolated local streams MUST
        be negotiated so that media remains isolated at the remote peer. This
        causes non-isolated media to become isolated at the receiving peer if
        any isolated tracks are added to the same
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code>.</p>
        <p class="note">Tracks that are not bound to a particular
        <var>peerIdentity</var> do not cause other streams to be isolated,
        these tracks simply do not have their content transmitted.</p>
        <p>If a stream becomes isolated after initially being accessible, or an
        isolated stream is added to an active session, then media for that
        stream is replaced by information-free content (e.g., black frames or
        silence).</p>
      </section>
      <section id="isolation-protection">
        <h4>Protection Afforded by Media Isolation</h4>
        <p>Media isolation ensures that the content of a
        <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> is not accessible to web applications.
        However, to ensure that media with a <var>peerIdentity</var> option set
        can be sent to peers, some meta-information about the media will be
        exposed to applications.</p>
        <p>Applications will be able to observe the parameters of the media
        that affect session negotiation and conversion into RTP. This includes
        the codecs that might be supported by the track, the bitrate, the
        number of packets, and the current settings that are set on the
        <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>.</p>
        <p>In particular, the <a href="#sec.stats-model">statistics</a> that
        <code><a>RTCPeerConnection</a></code> records are not reduced in
        capability. New statistics that might compromise isolation MUST be
        avoided, or explicitly suppressed for isolated streams.</p>
        <p>Most of these data are exposed to the network when the media is
        transmitted. Only the settings for the <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>
        present a new source of information. This can includes the frame rate
        and resolution of video tracks, the bandwidth of audio tracks, and
        other information about the source, which would not otherwise be
        revealed to a network observer. Since settings don't change at a high
        frequency or in response to changes in media content, settings only
        reveal limited reveal information about the content of a track.
        However, any setting that might change dynamically in response to the
        content of an isolated <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> MUST have changes
        suppressed.</p>

        <h2>RTCError Constructor</h2>
        <p>The RTCError Constructor is the <code>%RTCError%</code>
        intrinsic object. When <code>RTCError</code> is called as a
        function rather than as a constructor, it creates and initializes a new
        <code><a>RTCError</a></code> object. A call of the object as a function is
        equivalent to calling it as a constructor with the same arguments. Thus
        the function call <code><b>RTCError(</b>...<b>)</b></code>
        is equivalent to the object creation expression <code><b>new
        RTCError(</b>...<b>)</b></code> with the same
        arguments.</p>
        <p>The <code>RTCError</code> constructor is designed to be
        subclassable. It may be used as the value of an <code>extends</code>
        clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors that intend to
        inherit the specified <code>RTCError</code> behaviour must
        include a <code>super</code> call to the
        <code>RTCError</code> constructor to create and initialize
        the subclass instance with an [[\ErrorData]] internal slot.</p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Privacy and Security Considerations</h2>
    <p>This section is non-normative; it specifies no new behaviour, but
    instead summarizes information already present in other parts of the
    specification. The overall security considerations of the general set of
    APIs and protocols used in WebRTC are described in
    [[RTCWEB-SECURITY-ARCH]].</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Impact on same origin policy</h2>
      <p>This document extends the Web platform with the ability to set up real
      time, direct communication between browsers and other devices, including
      other browsers.</p>
      <p>This means that data and media can be shared between applications
      running in different browsers, or between an application running in the
      same browser and something that is not a browser, something that is an
      extension to the usual barriers in the Web model against sending data
      between entities with different origins.</p>
      <p>The WebRTC specification provides no user prompts or chrome indicators
      for communication; it assumes that once the Web page has been allowed to
      access media, it is free to share that media with other entities as it
      chooses. Peer-to-peer exchanges of data view WebRTC datachannels can thus
      occur without any user explicit consent or involvement, similarly as a
      server-mediated exchange (e.g. via Web Sockets) could occur without user
      involvement.</p>
      <p>The <code><a>peerIdentity</a></code> mechanism loads and executes
      JavaScript code from a third-party server acting as an identity provider.
      That code is executed in a separate JavaScript realm and does not affect
      the protections afforded by the same origin policy.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Revealing IP addresses</h2>
      <p>Even without WebRTC, the Web server providing a Web application will
      know the public IP address to which the application is delivered. Setting
      up communications exposes additional information about the
      browser&#8217;s network context to the web application, and may include
      the set of (possibly private) IP addresses available to the browser for
      WebRTC use. Some of this information has to be passed to the
      corresponding party to enable the establishment of a communication
      session.</p>
      <p>Revealing IP addresses can leak location and means of connection; this
      can be sensitive. Depending on the network environment, it can also
      increase the fingerprinting surface and create persistent cross-origin
      state that cannot easily be cleared by the user.</p>
      <p>A connection will always reveal the IP addresses proposed for
      communication to the corresponding party. The application can limit this
      exposure by choosing not to use certain addresses using the settings
      exposed by the <a>RTCIceTransportPolicy</a> dictionary, and by using
      relays (for instance TURN servers) rather than direct connections between
      participants. One will normally assume that the IP address of TURN
      servers is not sensitive information. These choices can for instance be
      made by the application based on whether the user has indicated consent
      to start a media connection with the other party.</p>
      <p>Mitigating the exposure of IP addresses to the application itself
      requires limiting the IP addresses that can be used, which will impact
      the ability to communicate on the most direct path between endpoints.
      Browsers are encouraged to provide appropriate controls for deciding
      which IP addresses are made available to applications, based on the
      security posture desired by the user. The choice of which addresses to
      expose is controlled by local policy (see [[RTCWEB-IP-HANDLING]] for
      details).</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Impact on local network</h2>
      <p>Since the browser is an active platform executing in a trusted network
      environment (inside the firewall), it is important to limit the damage
      that the browser can do to other elements on the local network, and it is
      important to protect data from interception, manipulation and
      modification by untrusted participants.</p>
      <p>Mitigations include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A user agent will always request permission from the correspondent
        user agent to communicate using ICE. This ensures that the user agent
        can only send to partners who you have shared credentials with.</li>
        <li>A user agent will always request ongoing permission to continue
        sending using ICE continued consent. This enables a receiver to
        withdraw consent to receive.</li>
        <li>A user agent will always encrypt data, with strong per-session
        keying (DTLS-SRTP).</li>
        <li>A user agent will always use congestion control. This ensures that
        WebRTC cannot be used to flood the network.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These measures are specified in the relevant IETF documents.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Confidentiality of Communications</h2>
      <p>The fact that communication is taking place cannot be hidden from
      adversaries that can observe the network, so this has to be regarded as
      public information.</p>
      <p>A mechanism, <code><a>peerIdentity</a></code>, is provided that gives
      Javascript the option of requesting media that the same javascript cannot
      access, but can only be sent to certain other entities.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Persistent information exposed by WebRTC</h2>
      <p>As described above, the list of IP addresses exposed by the WebRTC API
      can be used as a persistent cross-origin state.</p>
      <p>Beyond IP addresses, the WebRTC API exposes information about the
      underlying media system via the <code>RTCRtpSender.getCapabilities</code>
      and <code>RTCRtpReceiver.getCapabilities</code> methods, including
      detailed and ordered information about the codecs that the system is able
      to produce and consume. A subset of that information is likely to be
      represented in the SDP session descriptions generated, exposed and
      transmitted during <a href="#session-negotiation-model">session
      negotiation</a>. That information is in most cases persistent across time
      and origins, and increases the fingerprint surface of a given device.</p>
      <p>If set, the configured default ICE servers exposed by <a data-for=
      "RTCPeerConnection">getDefaultIceServers</a> on
      <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instances also provides persistent across
      time and origins information which increases the fingerprinting surface
      of a given browser.</p>
      <p>When establishing DTLS connections, the WebRTC API can generate
      certificates that can be persisted by the application (e.g. in
      IndexedDB). These certificates are not shared across origins, and get
      cleared when persistent storage is cleared for the origin.</p>
