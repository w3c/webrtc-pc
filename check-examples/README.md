# Check Examples
A script that extracts the example code snippets from the specification and
runs a code linter on them.

## Install and Run
`$ npm install`
`$ node check.js ../webrtc.html`

## Self Linting
Run the linter on the script itself (indentation rule differs from example
rules):
`$ npm run linter`
